# Project README

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a transformer-based model for natural language processing tasks using PyTorch, specifically focusing on the multi-head attention mechanism. Utilizing the PyTorch framework and the Transformers library by Hugging Face, this project aims to demonstrate the core components of transformer models, including multi-head attention mechanisms, and how they can be applied to process and understand textual data.The code provided includes functionalities such as loading datasets, tokenization, batching.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch >= 1.7.0
- Transformers library by Hugging Face

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

## Dataset

The dataset was taken from the Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skylion007/openwebtext

## Data Decompression and Splitting

### Description

This section introduces a utility for decompressing `.xz` compressed files located within a specified directory and splitting them into training and validation sets. Additionally, it generates a vocabulary file containing unique characters found across all datasets. This process is crucial for preparing the data for further analysis or model training.

### Implementation Details

The script begins by identifying all `.xz` files within the target directory using the `xz_files_in_dir` function. It then calculates a split index to divide the dataset into training and validation subsets, ensuring that approximately 90% of the data goes to training and the remaining 10% to validation.

For each subset, the script iterates over the corresponding files, decompresses them using LZMA compression, and appends the content to the designated output file (`train2.txt` for training data and `val2.txt` for validation data). During this process, it also collects all unique characters encountered in the text, updating a set named `vocab`. Finally, it writes this vocabulary to a separate file (`vocab2.txt`), one character per line.

### Usage

To use this script, specify the path to the directory containing the `.xz` files in the `folder_path` variable at the top of the script. The script will automatically handle the rest, creating the `train2.txt`, `val2.txt`, and `vocab2.txt` files in the current working directory.

### Benefits

This approach simplifies the data preparation process, especially when dealing with large datasets compressed for storage efficiency. By automating the decomposition and splitting of data, as well as the generation of a comprehensive vocabulary, researchers and developers can quickly prepare their data for subsequent analysis or model training without manual intervention.

## Key Components

### Libraries Used

- **PyTorch**: A popular open-source machine learning library for Python, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily due to its speed and flexibility.
- **Transformers**: A state-of-the-art library developed by Hugging Face, providing thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on texts such as classification, information extraction, summarization, translation, etc.

### Model Architecture

The project focuses on implementing a custom multi-head attention module within a transformer architecture. This component is crucial for understanding the context of words in a sentence by allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing an output.

### Data Processing

Data preprocessing involves tokenization, where text is converted into numerical representations that the model can understand. This project uses the GPT-2 tokenizer from the Transformers library, which supports efficient conversion of text into sequences of tokens.

### Training and Evaluation

While the provided code snippet does not include explicit training and evaluation loops, these are essential steps in developing and fine-tuning models. Typically, models are trained over multiple epochs, adjusting weights based on the loss calculated from predictions made on the training data. Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are used to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

## Usage

The script is designed to work with two files: `mini_train.txt` and `mini_val.txt`, which should contain the training and validation datasets respectively. The datasets are loaded into memory, encoded using GPT-2 tokenizer, and then processed through the transformer model.

### Running the Script

Before running the script, ensure that the `mini_train.txt` and `mini_val.txt` files are available in the same directory as the script. Then, execute the script using Python:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

## Code Structure

### Tokenization and Encoding

The script uses the GPT-2 tokenizer from the Transformers library to encode the input text. It also defines a function `truncate_sequence` to limit the sequence length to 1024 tokens.

### Dataset Loading

Two functions, `load_half_dataset_into_memory`, are used to load half of each dataset file into memory. This is a simple way to reduce memory usage during development.

### Batch Generation

The `get_batch` function generates batches of data for training or evaluation. It ensures that the batch size and block size requirements are met.

### Custom Multi-Head Attention Layer

A custom class `MultiHeadAttention` is implemented, which encapsulates the multi-head attention mechanism. This class inherits from `nn.Module` and overrides the `forward` method to perform the attention computation.

## Future Improvements

- Implement the full transformer model including encoder and decoder layers.
- Add support for different pre-trained models via command-line arguments.
- Include a training loop to train the model on the dataset.
- Evaluate the model performance on the validation set.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a starting point for exploring the capabilities of transformer models in natural language processing. By leveraging powerful libraries like PyTorch and Transformers, developers can build sophisticated models capable of understanding and generating human-like text.
