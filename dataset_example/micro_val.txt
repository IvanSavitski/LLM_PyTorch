So what is an API (besides an Application Programming Interface)?

Give people the actual database

Make a website that pulls from the database

Make an API that allows programmers to interact with the database

Imagine you worked for a large company named Word Co. that organized words, specifically English language words. Perhaps your company scanned a bunch of textbooks and collected all of the words, counted the words, and created a big database full of useful information related to words. Basically you have a big set of information and one day your company (Word Co.) decides it wants to make all of that data available for other companies or allow individuals to see or access it. What are your options?The first option is probably not a good one because the database can be huge (potentially gigabytes or terabytes of information), you may be using a proprietary database ( such as Google's BigTable ) or software, or maybe you just spent millions of dollars collecting this information and you want to charge people for accessing it.

The second option may be a really neat idea but might not work if you wanted a mobile device or app to access it, or if you wanted to present the information in a different way other than a chart or web form. Imagine if someone wanted to make a Hangman game where you try to guess a random word (maybe a random word that was pulled from the big database of English language words) before a stick figure is "hung". This is something the website cannot directly perform.

An API allows people to grab information (or use services) that are part of a huge data set in ways that might not be imagined by the people who created that large data set. If Word Co. organized English words and created an API to access those words, let's take a minute to imagine what others can create with it:

Hangman (as mentioned above)

A computer opponent in Scrabble

A word of the day app

A spell checker

A domain name brainstorming tool

Weather services usually have API's

Google has a ton of API's (like their Maps API, their search engine, and just about everything else)

Facebook allows third-party developers to interact with the Facebook data

Twitter

Nearly everything else

So how do I "connect to" or use an API?

Make an HTTP request to a web server. Usually you'll include a variable or two that is passed in through the URL Get some data back (typically XML) Parse the XML (the XML is just a big character stream and you'll want to grab certain pieces of it and turn it into other data types or create an object) Use that data to do neat things! (Like create a Hangman game with a random word you just grabbed)

Which are all applications or tools that Word Co. doesn't have the time or desire to create. API's are usually intended to allow third parties to create awesome things using existing data that a company has already harvested and collected.Although many API's are different, it often boils down to making a request and getting some data. Some API's give you a bunch of code or libraries that you add to your project, and then use that code to make the requests, but many other API's are quite simple. If you are new to programming, I'd suggest looking for REST or so called "API's. Other ways to access API's such asalso exist, but in my opinion are a little harder to get started with. Fortunately many API's that used to be SOAP based are now REST based.Why XML? Because it's a great intermediary "language". Imagine if you wrote your Hangman game in Java and the Random Word API gave you Python code back. That wouldn't be very useful. Or if you wrote something in C/C++ and an API gave you a serialized Java object.

What makes XML so popular (especially with API's) is that it allows you to use whichever language you want, and gives you data is that both human readable and computer readable. Just about any programming language comes with standard libraries to parse XML quickly and easily. If you're an advanced programmer, it also allows you to build objects or data structures (like if you're dealing with A TON of data) exactly how you want them instead of forcing you to accept whatever the API gives you.

A concrete example in Java

Make an HTTP request to http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather=Location where Location is whatever you want (A postal code or city).

<xml_api_reply version="1"> <weather module_id="0" tab_id="0" mobile_row="0" mobile_zipped="1" row="0" section="0"> <forecast_information> <city data="Seattle, WA"/> <postal_code data="Seattle WA"/> <latitude_e6 data=""/> <longitude_e6 data=""/> <forecast_date data="2011-09-29"/> <current_date_time data="2011-09-29 17:53:00 +0000"/> <unit_system data="US"/> </forecast_information> <current_conditions> <condition data="Clear"/> <temp_f data="62"/> <temp_c data="17"/> <humidity data="Humidity: 62%"/> <icon data="/ig/images/weather/sunny.gif"/> <wind_condition data="Wind: N at 4 mph"/> </current_conditions> <forecast_conditions> <day_of_week data="Thu"/> <low data="56"/> <high data="72"/> <icon data="/ig/images/weather/sunny.gif"/> <condition data="Clear"/> </forecast_conditions> <forecast_conditions> <day_of_week data="Fri"/> <low data="56"/> <high data="70"/> <icon data="/ig/images/weather/mostly_sunny.gif"/> <condition data="Partly Sunny"/> </forecast_conditions> <forecast_conditions> <day_of_week data="Sat"/> <low data="49"/> <high data="65"/> <icon data="/ig/images/weather/rain.gif"/> <condition data="Showers"/> </forecast_conditions> <forecast_conditions> <day_of_week data="Sun"/> <low data="54"/> <high data="65"/> <icon data="/ig/images/weather/chance_of_rain.gif"/> <condition data="Chance of Rain"/> </forecast_conditions> </weather> </xml_api_reply>

SAX (Simple API for XML) parsers are stream oriented parsers and typically use less memory and are faster

(Simple API for XML) parsers are stream oriented parsers and typically use less memory and are faster DOM (Document Object Model) parsers are tree traversal parsers and can consume more memory if you're dealing with large amounts of XML

Let's make something! Imagine you wanted to create your own Android weather app. Since we aren't meteorologists, we'll get all of the weather information from someone else-- Google's Weather API. Other options are the National Weather Service (in the U.S.) or maybe Weather Underground . Most of the API's out there are well documented and tell you how you should connect, use, or interface with them. Google's Weather API is a little weird in that there is no documentation. I think it's sort of a secret API. But here's how you use it:That's it! You'll get a bunch of XML back with the current weather and forecast information. You can even try it out in your web browser (since your web browser makes HTTP requests on a very regular basis). Let's see what happens when we use Seattle WA as an example (from http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather=Seattle+WA ):And let's imagine we want to extract the highs and lows in this XML so we can use them in our Android weather app. As mentioned, many programming languages have built in libraries that allow you to parse the XML. Since XML is so popular, there are even multiple approaches to parsing it, even within a given language. Java has both a DOM parser and a SAX parser built in. Python also has a DOM parser and a SAX parser built in.When should you use one over the other? When you are dealing with HUGE amounts of data. Most of the time (such as right now) you don't need to worry and can use whichever one you're comfortable with. I'll be using the Java SAX parser in this example.

Remember the steps to do this? 1) Make an HTTP request to the API, typically passing in a URL variable, 2) Get the data back and then parse it, and finally 3) Do neat things! Let's see what that looks like in Java code:

Weather.java (first draft)

import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.net.URL; public class Weather { public static final String URL_SOURCE = "http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather="; public static void main(String[] args) { /*** Create the request ***/ // Let's pick a location: String location = "Seattle, WA"; // Create the URL: String query = URL_SOURCE + location; // Replace blanks with HTML-Equivalent: query = query.replace(" ", "%20"); /*** * Make the request (This needs to be in a try-catch block because things can go wrong) ***/ try { // Turn the string into a URL object URL urlObject = new URL(query); // Open the stream (which returns an InputStream): InputStream in = urlObject.openStream(); /** Now parse the data (the stream) that we received back ***/ // Coming shortly since we need to set up a parser } catch(IOException ioe) { ioe.printStackTrace(); } } }

So at this point we have some simple Java code that connects to the Google Weather API and receives some data back. In the above case, we are getting our data (the XML) in the form of an InputStream. In other languages you'll still probably be receiving the data as a stream. Streams and I/O are a pretty big part of programming, so if you're not sure how to work with these, now is a good time to start. Anyways, we now need to set up the XML parser. As mentioned I am picking the SAX parser for this example, and as the SAX parser explains on its website, you need to create a handler for handling the XML. In other words, you need to tell it what to do when it encounters specific parts of the XML. In this case we'll look for <low>, <high>, and <day_of_week> tags. To define this behavior we'll extend SAX's DefaultHandler (meaning we give it more functionality than the default functionality). Let's see what this looks like:

GoogleHandler.java

public class GoogleHandler extends DefaultHandler { // Create three array lists to store the data public ArrayList<Integer> lows = new ArrayList<Integer>(); public ArrayList<Integer> highs = new ArrayList<Integer>(); public ArrayList<String> days = new ArrayList<String>(); // Make sure that the code in DefaultHandler's // constructor is called: public GoogleHandler() { super(); } /*** Below are the three methods that we are extending ***/ @Override public void startDocument() { System.out.println("Start document"); } @Override public void endDocument() { System.out.println("End document"); } // This is where all the work is happening: @Override public void startElement(String uri, String name, String qName, Attributes atts) { if(qName.compareTo("day_of_week") == 0) { String day = atts.getValue(0); System.out.println("Day: " + day); this.days.add(day); } if(qName.compareToIgnoreCase("low") == 0) { int low = Integer.parseInt(atts.getValue(0)); System.out.println("Low: " + low); this.lows.add(low); } if(qName.compareToIgnoreCase("high") == 0) { int high = Integer.parseInt(atts.getValue(0)); System.out.println("High: " + high); this.highs.add(high); } } }

And now that we have defined how the XML parser should behave, let's add in our GoogleHandler to the Weather code:

Weather.java (final draft)

import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.net.URL; import org.xml.sax.InputSource; import org.xml.sax.SAXException; import org.xml.sax.XMLReader; import org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderFactory; public class Weather { public static final String URL_SOURCE = "http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather="; public static void main(String[] args) { /*** Create the request ***/ // Let's pick a location: String location = "Seattle, WA"; // Create the URL: String query = URL_SOURCE + location; // Replace blanks with HTML-Equivalent: query = query.replace(" ", "%20"); /*** * Make the request (This needs to be in a try-catch block because things can go wrong) ***/ try { // Turn the string into a URL object URL urlObject = new URL(query); // Open the stream (which returns an InputStream): InputStream in = urlObject.openStream(); /** Now parse the data (the stream) that we received back ***/ // Create an XML reader XMLReader xr = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader(); // Tell that XML reader to use our special Google Handler GoogleHandler ourSpecialHandler = new GoogleHandler(); xr.setContentHandler(ourSpecialHandler); // We have an InputStream, but let's just wrap it in // an InputSource (the SAX parser likes it that way) InputSource inSource = new InputSource(in); // And parse it! xr.parse(inSource); } catch(IOException ioe) { ioe.printStackTrace(); } catch(SAXException se) { se.printStackTrace(); } } }

Doesn't look so bad, does it? If you go ahead compile the two files (both Weather.java and GoogleHandler.java) you should be able to run it without any problems. Here's the output when I ran it:

Start document Day: Thu Low: 56 High: 72 Day: Fri Low: 56 High: 70 Day: Sat Low: 49 High: 65 Day: Sun Low: 54 High: 65 End document

In the GoogleHandler there are System.out.println() commands, but it also adds the integers and strings into their own array lists which you can now access in a more familiar way (such as calling days.get(0) to get the first day of the week in that array list).

A concrete example in Python 3

And finally let's take a quick look at how to do this in Python, again using a SAX parser. As you can see, Python does quite a bit of heavy lifting for you (such as making the HTTP request and getting the XML -- which is one line of code). Go ahead and copy/modify this code for any of your projects. It was built and tested with Python 3.2.2 in October 2011.

Weather.py

import urllib.request import xml.sax # Create some lists to store the data: lows = [] highs = [] days = [] # Define our special Google Handler that extends # what the default content handler does class GoogleHandler(xml.sax.ContentHandler): def startElement(self, name, attrs): if name=="day_of_week": print("Day:", attrs['data']) days.append(attrs['data']) if name=="low": print("Low:", attrs['data']) lows.append(attrs['data']) if name=="high": print("High:", attrs['data']) highs.append(attrs['data']) # Make an HTTP request at the specified URL # and get back a bunch of XML xmlResponse = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.google.com/ig/api?weather=Seattle+WA') # Create a SAX Parser parser = xml.sax.make_parser() # Tell the parser to use our special handler parser.setContentHandler(GoogleHandler()) # And parse the XML! parser.parse(xmlResponse) # Print out the lists: print("Days:", days) print("Lows:", lows) print("Highs:", highs)

And let's see what sort of output we get when we run it:

Day: Thu Low: 56 High: 72 Day: Fri Low: 56 High: 70 Day: Sat Low: 49 High: 65 Day: Sun Low: 54 High: 65 Days: ['Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'] Lows: ['56', '56', '49', '54'] Highs: ['72', '70', '65', '65']

I hope this tutorial was helpful. If you have questions please ask away. I'll also add that our fictional Word Co. (as mentioned at the top of this article) API isn't just a made up concept to explain API's. It actually exists!                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279133-67dfa07c6d7ee990be24d9252ab93567.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007067 00000000000 015150  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A motion in a lawsuit against BuzzFeed and its founder, Ben Smith, mocked its targets by using a BuzzFeed-esque writing style against them (emphasis added):





Aleksej Gubarev and his companies XBT Holdings and Webzilla sued BuzzFeed and Smith for defamation following the publication of a “dossier” alleging that he and his companies had engaged in criminal political behavior.

BuzzFeed apparently sought a dismissal of the lawsuit on the grounds of a Florida-based federal court's lack of jurisdiction. If the motion for dismissal were to be denied, it requested a transfer of the lawsuit to a New York-based federal court.

Gubarev’s motion also mocked the grounds for BuzzFeed’s aforementioned requests for a dismissal or transfer of the lawsuit from Florida to New York:

In a somewhat remarkable Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs BuzzFeed, Inc. (“BuzzFeed”) and Ben Smith (“Mr. Smith”) intimate that their ties to Florida are so sparse that, collectively, they can barely find Florida on a map and that, as a result, the present case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or transferred to the Southern District of New York. In truth, however, this case does not present a “close call” jurisdictionally: Defendants have extensive and continuing ties to Florida; committed an intentional tort in Florida; and caused harm to a Florida corporation. Defendants regularly and routinely send their reporters to Florida; report on Florida-centric stories; host celebrity-laden parties in Florida; livestream events from Florida; work with Florida advertisers; and generally target and solicit an audience in Florida. Indeed, it could be argued that BuzzFeed is as much “at home” in Florida as are sunny beaches and Florida orange juice, particularly since BuzzFeed has created and circulated on its website dozens of articles specifically created for its clients, VisitFlorida.com (the Official Florida Tourism Industry Marketing Corporation) and the Florida Department of Citrus (the official promoters of Florida Orange Juice). … The article was circulated in Florida; Defendants have pervasive contacts with Florida; there is every reason for Defendants to have expected that their actions would subject them to jurisdiction in Florida; and there is no hardship to Defendants in being required to defend an action in Florida.

In response to BuzzFeed’s and Smith’s shared claim of a limited connection to Florida as the basis for a dismissal or transfer of the lawsuit, Gubarev’s motion claims the two defendants have deep connections to the Sunshine State: BuzzFeed produces content focusing on Florida, sends its employees to Florida on various projects, and Smith has been to Florida various times in a business capacity on behalf of BuzzFeed.

Gubarev’s motion notes that BuzzFeed claimed to have dedicated “four reporters working near full-time” in its attempt to verify allegations in the dossier. Also noted is Smith’s public statements that he made the made the final decision to publish the dossier at BuzzFeed in his capacity as the site’s chief editor.https://twitchy.com/dougp-3137/2017/03/29/ha-title-of-motion-in-lawsuit-against-buzzfeed-is-amazing/

Your odds of picking the winning combo are 175.7 million to one. Divide one number by the other. That means a ticket is worth $3.07, right? Maybe you should buy as many as you can?

Not so fast. There’s a little more to the math here. You have to allow for not only the long odds that you’ll pick the right numbers but also the short odds that you will be sharing that jackpot.

It turns out that each ticket has a value a bit shy of the one dollar you pay for it. But at least you’re doing a lot better than you would in a lottery that doesn’t have a carryover from the previous drawing. If you like to buy lottery tickets, now is a good time.

I’ll explain how you calculate odds, and how to improve them slightly. I’ll also give you some sad news about the time value of money and the taxation of gamblers.

The jackpot is a giant one because no one picked the numbers to win the $363 million pot offered in Tuesday’s drawing. That sum is added to a percentage of the take from ticket sales over the next 72 hours to arrive at the Mar. 30 pot.

The frenzy of ticket buying that began Wednesday leads to an official projection of a $540 million pot. I would bet that the operators are lowballing here. My speculative guess: a pot near $600 million, with just under 620 million tickets sold. That would be more than triple the number sold for the Tuesday draw. You can buy tickets in 42 states plus the District of Columbia.

Biggest jackpot so far: $390 million in March 2007, shared by two winning tickets.

To win the big one you have to pick which five numbers between 1 and 56 will be pulled, and then pick a second number between 1 and 46. The order of the first five is not important and there are no repeats.

Here’s how you get the odds: multiply 56x55x54x53x52, then divide by 5x4x3x2 to get 3.82 million. Now multiply that by 46 to get 175.7 million.

If you get the five-number combo but not the 1-to-46 play, then you win a flat $250,000 (except in California, where it gets more complicated). Lesser matches have smaller payoffs, ranging down to $2.

If you knew no one else could play, it would make sense to buy a ticket. In fact, you should buy all the numbers. You’d invest $176 million and haul in almost triple that.

Alas, other people have heard about this jackpot. So what are the odds on sharing? In the past decade there have been 13 shared jackpots. Three jackpot winners neglected to claim their prizes; they were from Brooklyn, Queens and an unidentified place in New York State.

History, though, is an imperfect judge of odds. Here’s how to do it with a calculator.

Call the number of tickets sold T. Call that 175.7 million figure X. Use ^ as the sign for exponents (2^3, for example, means 2x2x2). Call the base of natural logarithms e (it’s roughly 2.718).

If you did win, what are the odds that no one else won? It equals (1-1/X)^T. That’s a mess, but a very close approximation is e^(-T/X). Comes to 0.03 on my calculator when I assume that T = 616 million.

Translation: If you do win, there’s only a 3% chance you’ll have the big prize to yourself.

Odds there will be exactly one other winner? Take the 0.03 and multiply by T/X. I get 0.105. So there's a 10.5% chance that if you win, you will be splitting the pot in two.

Odds for two other winners: take the last number you had, multiply by T/X again and divide by 2. Now you have 0.184.

For three other winners: previous number, multiplied by T/X and divided by 3. Now you're up to 0.216.

This could go on, but the numbers start to get pretty small. There’s only a 1.7% chance that if you win you’ll be splitting the prize 9 ways.

Add it all up, and you find that a $600 million pot with 616 million tickets competing makes each chance on the big prize worth 94 cents.

Now there’s the time value problem. Turns out you don’t get the prize right away. You have to take it in installments.

It reminds one of that joke from Soviet days: Did you hear about the $1 million Russian lottery? You win $1 a year for 1 million years.

The Mega Millions deal isn’t quite that bad, but if you want your money right away there’s a 28% haircut. So your 94 cents shrinks to 68 cents. The smaller prizes are worth something, somewhere around 18 cents. Add it up: Each one-dollar ticket is worth not even a dollar.

Now there’s the little problem of taxes. Big wins ($10,000 and up) are taxable. The smaller ones ($150 and down) are not, because you are entitled to deduct gambling losses up to the amount of gambling wins, and if you win $150 you probably spent more than $150 on tickets.

If you live in New York, you have a high probability of being subject to federal, state and city taxes, and a federal alternative minimum tax for good measure. You also have, as noted above, a high probability of being too dumb to collect.

The tax collectors don’t stop with income tax. This brings us to the curious case of the Waffle House waitress, decided a few weeks ago in U.S. Tax Court.

A patron of the Grand Bay, Ala. Waffle House decided to leave behind a Florida lottery ticket. He evidently either didn’t realize that the lottery had been drawn the night before or just didn’t check the numbers. Had he done so, he would have realized that he was leaving a $5 million tip.

The waitress, being a good soul, transferred the ticket to a corporation in which relatives were shareholders. There was an unwritten promise in her family, she said, to share winnings.

The IRS said she was just being nice and hit her up for a $771,570 gift tax. This would be on top of any income tax being paid by her or the relatives.

The judge sided largely with the IRS, although he cut the tax bill a little on the theory that, at the time of the ticket transfer, there was some risk that fellow restaurant workers would horn in on the jackpot. They sued her but she won that battle.

Blankenship was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety and served a year in prison for his role in failing to prevent an accident at Massey’s Upper Big Branch Mine that killed 29 people in 2010. He was released from prison last May — and has now decided to run against a longtime foe, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), according to WHCS TV.

The former mine executive has remained unrepentant for his role in the accident, instead blaming federal regulators, while attacking Manchin for how he handled the explosion when he was governor.

Blankenship has been aggressively critical of Manchin for years, and last month put out a TV ad accusing Manchin of having “blood on his hands” — a line Manchin used about Blankenship during the trial.

Blankenship, an extremely wealthy self-funder, has long been a major player in West Virginia GOP politics. But given his conviction, he’s far from the favorite to face Manchin — Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-WV) and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrissey (R) are already in the race.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279011-4a3ce643809acf1aa740ee5e4e4def4a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002041 00000000000 015376  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Tom Petty may have been born in a red state but the "Southern Accents" rocker doesn't appear to be changing his tune about saying no to conservatives who try to make his melodies their theme songs.

Michele Bachmann may be doing well in the polls in Iowa, but there's a Floridian in Malibu who isn't pleased that the Minnesotan is using his hit tune "American Girl" without his permission.

Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Tom Petty reportedly has had enough of Bachmann using his 1977 hit single in her campaign and has reportedly issued a cease-and-desist letter to the conservative's camp.

Kelly O'Donnell announced the matter Monday on "NBC Nightly News."

"When Bachmann left the stage here, her campaign played the Tom Petty hit song, 'American Girl.' Turns out Petty isn't pleased. His manager says they will ask the Bachmann campaign not to use that song," O'Donnell said, adding that Petty had also asked former president George W. Bush not to use any of his tunes. Bush wanted to use the more contemporary "I Won't Back Down," which the rocker nixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279065-4975e97c70767fc09f39ebb0f96c720d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001516 00000000000 015100  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        My secret santa is better than your secret santa. Fact.

I woke up this morning and my sister gave me a massive parcel, and I had to wait for my dad so I could open it. It was kind of like Christmas morning, but 2 days late. I opened the box and there was a ton of cool stuff. My secret santa, Annie (I couldn't really read her username at this point) had given me two t-shirts from local breweries to Alaska. I like beer. This is a good thing. She says the nerf stuff is because she was forcing American pro-gun-ism on me. And I assume the candy is there because its tasty. The box was kinda practical, I guess, too. But anyway, whomever gets Annie next year will be lucky. She's a bad-ass. She's even got my dad and sister to sign up for the next big exchange. I'm off to go sweat in my shirt and shoot my sister till she gets pissed at me now.                                                                                                                                                                                  0279001-69787fc7ec0f9b47bfd4f99a2dd8b988.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004637 00000000000 015336  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Elblag Canal, also called the Elblag-Ostroda Canal, is a 150-years-old canal in Poland that runs from Elblag to Ostroda. At over 80 km in length, it is the longest navigable canal still in use in Poland. It is also one of the most interesting canals in Europe. Elblag Canal’s uniqueness arises from its peculiar choice of engineering to tackle a particularly difficult section of the route where the water level rises by 100 meters. This particular section is located between Druzno Lake and Piniewo Lake, a distance of about 10 km. Because the difference in height was too large, it was impractical to build traditional locks. Instead, an ingenious system of inclined planes was employed where the boats are lifted out of the water and placed into tracks and dragged across dry lands.

The inclines consist of a trolley on two parallel rail tracks. A boat would navigate itself onto the trolley, which sits under water, and then would get pulled up or down over the grass to the other level. At the other end, the trolleys would once again go under the water until the vessel can float out freely. The entire system is operated by water power. A second carriage weighted down by water is lowered down the incline to counterbalance and pull the upward moving carriage. There were originally four inclined planes with a fifth added later, replacing five wooden locks.

Elblag Canal’s brilliant solution to the problem has been hailed as one of the most significant hydro-engineering achievement of the country. A Polish newspaper named it one of the Seven Wonders of Poland, and the UNESCO has the canal listed as a memorial to world culture inheritances.

Poland deserves all the accolades for Elblag Canal, but the idea of using inclined planes to get the boats up was neither new nor unique. The Morris Canal, in northern New Jersey in the United States, was the first to implement the inclined-plane concept – an idea devised by a professor of Columbia University. The canal was built 13 years before construction of the Elblag Canal even commenced. The Big Chute Marine Railway in Ontario, Canada, is another inclined plane boat lift that is still in use. Although Elblag Canal is also in operation, today it’s only used for the entertainment of tourists.

Indeed, one of Trump’s biggest champions in the U.K. was the highest-profile advocate for Brexit, Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, who even appeared at a campaign event with Trump and other right-wing European leaders.

But the parallels don’t stop there. After all, domestic-political decisions in a world based on international commerce have global consequences. Although some of the most-severe warnings have yet to materialize, there have been high costs: The pound is near three-decade lows, which makes U.K. exports more attractive, but also raises the cost of imported goods and the risk of inflation; the U.K.’s AAA credit rating, the highest possible, has been downgraded, making the government’s borrowing costs higher; and the medium-term economic prospects appear anemic. The instability hinges on uncertainty over the exact nature of the U.K.’s exit from the EU. Talks on what the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU will look like can only begin when the government invokes Article 50 of the EU charter, which it plans to next year despite last week’s legal hurdle. Those talks, which will likely take two years, will decide whether the U.K. will retain its access to the EU’s single market, which U.K. businesses want but EU leaders are unlikely to yield to unless it’s accompanied by the free movement of workers. That demand, in turn, is one to which the U.K. government is unlikely to accede. In the meantime, stocks, which had slumped after the Brexit vote, have stabilized, recovering most of their losses in the nearly six months since.

It might be the same with Trump—and indeed some of signs could be seen Wednesday. When the possibility of a Trump victory began to emerge Tuesday night, stocks across the world began to tank. At one point, Dow futures were down more than 800 points, but since the U.S. markets opened Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 have mostly recovered. The Nasdaq is down. Stocks in Asia were sharply lower, but European markets recovered most of their early losses. What this means for the broader economy is harder to predict. Trump’s actions and policy prescriptions over the coming days and weeks will dictate whether his election was a black-swan event or if it will be business-as-usual for the U.S. and global economies.

What’s next? Brexit, and now Trump’s victory, might have stunned the establishment, but populist right- and left-wing groups have been gaining ground, especially in Western Europe, since the 2008 global recession, warning against job losses, immigration, and free trade. Three Western European countries— France, Germany, and the Netherlands—have elections scheduled for next year. Each has populist right-wing political parties that are gaining support, and each of those parties, no doubt, has taken the successes of Brexit and Trump as good signs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279003-5ce46107903690ca07572de21b267415.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003751 00000000000 014527  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Demonstrators blocked the entrance of Uber’s corporate headquarters in San Francisco Friday morning in protest of CEO Travis Kalanick’s connection to President Donald Trump, whose inauguration was taking place at the same time across the country in Washington, D.C.

The group of 40 to 50 demonstrators chained themselves to the building’s entrances, preventing any employees from entering. The protestors also blocked off Market Street, one of downtown San Francisco’s central traffic arteries, for a time, holding large signs that read “Uber collaborates with Trump” and “SF resists Trump.” Demonstrators also pinned signs to their clothes that read “Uber collaborates, we resist.”

Kalanick would seem at first like an unlikely target for Trump opponents’ ire. He has been on record in favor of Obamacare (which Trump has vowed to dismantle) and of a tax hike on the wealthy (Trump plans to reduce top income tax rates). In October 2015, Kalanick had joked to a group of college students that “I’m going to move to China if Trump wins,” according to the Washington Post.

However, Kalanick upset many in December when he was added to then President-elect Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. The forum, which also includes Elon Musk of Tesla (tsla) and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase (jpm), among others, is expected to meet frequently with the president to offer advice as he tries to advance his economic goals.

The protest was one of several that occurred in San Francisco Friday morning, causing several disruptions in traffic and mass transit. Trump won just 9.4% of the vote in San Francisco County in November, to 85.5% for Hillary Clinton, according to Associated Press data tabulated by the San Francisco Chronicle.

But two experiments being run by the company suggest it is dabbling with the idea of offering people private and personalized feeds alongside the public one.

The experiments may provide a preview of how Twitter will further expand a service that started out simple but is now becoming more complex (see “Facebook and Twitter Are Converging”).

Opting in to the experiments involves following two special Twitter accounts, which then send personalized messages using the service’s direct message function.

The first of these experiments, @magicrecs, was launched in June. Its followers receive direct messages containing recommendations for other Twitter accounts and tweets that may be of interest. The account’s profile says that it will also recommend “content,” although I’ve not seen any reports of that happening yet.

A second experimental account with a similar design appeared earlier this month. Called @eventparrot, it sends its followers personalized updates on breaking news via direct messages.

Making these services regular accounts that people follow to opt in to is a clever way to introduce this new kind of function without changing Twitter’s overall design much. Twitter could build many more of these services—they’d inevitably be referred to as “apps”—and even make money by using them to push targeted ads.

Blame it on the volatility of the weather.

Wholesale electricity costs are expected to be 6.95 cents per kilowatt hour in May, although another 1.69 cents will be added to the supply charge to true-up the actual cost of electricity last month, when there was a 2.6 cents credit that lowered the supply cost considerably.

You want the bottom line?

To estimate what the increase will be this month for a typical Capital Region household, we took a real bill from a National Grid customer in Delmar who has a household of four people.

They used 522 kilowatt hours of electricity between March 13 and April 15.

Last month, their electric bill was $65.86, an amount that is due in about nine days.

If they use the same 522 kilowatt hours before their next billing cycle ends about two weeks from now, their electric bill will be $91.25, an increase of $25.29.

If you use more electricity – maybe you have two big-screen TVs and a treadmill – your electric bill may rise more, perhaps $30.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279059-be240eb148816d8c4782bd93541b4dbf.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000050736 00000000000 015137  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Amazing Stories Shaver's first published work, the novella "I Remember Lemuria", was the cover story in the March 1945

Fantastic devoted to the "Shaver Mystery" was published in 1958 A special issue ofdevoted to the "Shaver Mystery" was published in 1958

He achieved notoriety in the years following World War II as the author of controversial stories that were printed in science fiction magazines (primarily Amazing Stories), in which he claimed that he had had personal experience of a sinister, ancient civilization that harbored fantastic technology in caverns under the earth. The controversy stemmed from the claim by Shaver, and his editor and publisher Ray Palmer, that Shaver's writings, while presented in the guise of fiction, were fundamentally true. Shaver's stories were promoted by Ray Palmer as "The Shaver Mystery".

During the last decades of his life, Shaver devoted himself to "rock books"—stones that he believed had been created by the advanced ancient races and embedded with legible pictures and texts. He produced paintings based on the rock images and photographed the rock books extensively, as well as writing about them. Posthumously, Shaver has gained a reputation as an artist and his paintings and photos have been exhibited in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere.

Biography [ edit ]

Shaver claimed to have worked in a factory where, in 1932, odd things began to occur. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, Shaver "began to notice that one of the welding guns on his job site, 'by some freak of its coil's field atunements', was allowing him to hear the thoughts of the men working around him. More frighteningly, he then received the telepathic record of a torture session conducted by malign entities in caverns deep within the earth". According to Michael Barkun, Shaver offered inconsistent accounts of how he first learned of the hidden cavern world, but that the assembly line story was the "most common version".[1] Shaver said he then quit his job, and became a hobo for a while.

Barkun writes that "Shaver was hospitalized briefly for psychiatric problems in 1934, but there does not appear to have been a clear diagnosis".[2] Barkun notes that afterwards, Shaver's whereabouts and actions cannot be reliably traced until the early 1940s. In 1971, Ray Palmer reported that "Shaver had spent eight years not in the Cavern World, but in a mental institution".[3][4]

The Shaver Mystery [ edit ]

During 1943, Shaver wrote a letter to Amazing Stories magazine. He claimed to have discovered an ancient language he called "Mantong", a sort of Proto-Human language that was the source of all Earthly languages. In Mantong, each sound had a hidden meaning, and by applying this formula to any word in any language, one could decode a secret meaning to any word, name or phrase. Editor Ray Palmer applied the Mantong formula to several words, and said he realized Shaver was onto something.

According to Palmer (in his autobiography The Secret World), Palmer wrote back to Shaver, asking how he had learned of Mantong. Shaver responded with an approximately 10,000-word document entitled "A Warning to Future Man". Shaver wrote of extremely advanced prehistoric races who had built cavern cities inside the Earth before abandoning Earth for another planet due to damaging radiation from the Sun. Those ancients also abandoned some of their own offspring here, a minority of whom remained noble and human "Teros", while most degenerated over time into a population of mentally impaired sadists known as "Deros"—short for "detrimental robots". Shaver's "robots" were not mechanical constructs, but were robot-like due to their savage behavior.

These Deros still lived in the cave cities, according to Shaver, kidnapping surface-dwelling people by the thousands for meat or torture. With the sophisticated "ray" machinery that the great ancient races had left behind, they spied on people and projected tormenting thoughts and voices into our minds (reminiscent of schizophrenia's "influencing machines" such as the Air loom). Deros could be blamed for nearly all misfortunes, from minor "accidental" injuries or illnesses to airplane crashes and catastrophic natural disasters. Women especially were singled out for brutal treatment, including rape, and Mike Dash notes that "[s]ado-masochism was one of the prominent themes of Shaver's writings".[5] Though generally confined to their caves, Shaver claimed that the Deros sometimes traveled with spaceships or rockets, and had dealings with equally evil extraterrestrial beings. Shaver claimed to possess first-hand knowledge of the Deros and their caves, insisting he had been their prisoner for several years.

Palmer edited and rewrote the manuscript, increasing the total word count to a novella length of 31,000. Palmer insisted that he did not alter the main elements of Shaver's story, but that he only added an exciting plot so the story would not read "like a dull recitation".[1] Retitled "I Remember Lemuria!"; it was published in the March 1945 issue of Amazing.[6] The issue sold out, and generated quite a response: between 1945 and 1949, many letters arrived attesting to the truth of Shaver's claims (tens of thousands of letters, according to Palmer). The correspondents claimed that they, too, had heard strange voices or encountered denizens of the Hollow Earth. One of the letters to Amazing Stories was from a woman who claimed to have gone into a deep subbasement of a Paris, France building via a secret elevator. After months of rape and other torture, the woman was freed by a benevolent Tero.[7] Another letter claiming involvement with Deros came from Fred Crisman, later to gain notoriety for his role in the Maury Island Incident and the John F. Kennedy Assassination. "Shaver Mystery Club" societies were created in several cities. The controversy gained some notice in the mainstream press at the time, including a mention in a 1951 issue of Life magazine.

Palmer claimed that Amazing Stories magazine had a great increase of circulation because of the Shaver Mystery, and the magazine emphasized the Shaver Mystery for several years. Barkun notes that, by any measure, the Shaver Mystery was successful in increasing sales of Amazing Stories. There was disagreement as to the precise increase in circulation, but Barkun notes that reliable sources reflect an increase in monthly circulation from about 135,000 to 185,000.[1]

From 1945 to 1948, Barkun notes that about 75% of the issues of Amazing Stories featured Shaver Mystery content: sometimes to the near-exclusion of any other topic. Historian Mike Dash declares that "Shaver's tales were amongst the wildest ever spun, even in the pages of the pulp science fiction magazines of the period".[5] He also published in Other Worlds magazine; the first issue featured his story "The Fall of Lemuria".

Many science fiction fans felt compelled to condemn the Shaver Mystery as "the Shaver Hoax". These fans, already distressed by Palmer's shift away from the literary or hard science fiction of earlier years to often slapdash space opera, organized letter-writing campaigns to try to persuade the publishers of Amazing Stories to cease all Shaver Mystery articles. In fact, Palmer printed a number of critical or skeptical letters sent to Amazing Stories, and he and other contributors occasionally rebutted or replied to such letters in print. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, "[t]he young Harlan Ellison, later a famously abrasive writer, allegedly badgered [Palmer] into admitting that the Shaver Mystery was a 'publicity grabber'; when the story came out, Palmer angrily responded that this was hardly the same thing as calling it a hoax".[3] Dash writes that the "critics of the 'Shaver Mystery' were quick to point out that its author was suffering from several of the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia, and that many of the letters pouring into Amazing recounting personal experiences that backed up the author's stories patently came from the sorts of people who would otherwise spend their time claiming that they were being persecuted by invisible voices or their neighbor's dog".[5]

During 1948, Amazing Stories ceased all publication of Shaver's stories. Palmer would later claim the magazine was pressured by sinister outside forces to make the change: science fiction fans would credit their boycott and letter-writing campaigns for the change. The magazine's owners said later that the Shaver Mystery had simply run its course and sales were decreasing.

The Shaver Mystery Clubs had surprising longevity: representatives of a club discussed the Shaver Mystery on John Nebel's popular radio show several times through the late 1950s. Nebel said he thought the discussion was entertaining, but in extant recordings he was also skeptical about the entire subject.

Even after the pulp magazines lost popularity, Palmer continued promoting the Shaver Mystery to a diminishing audience via the periodical The Hidden World. Lanier describes the magazine as "Shaver in the raw" with little of Palmer's editing. Shaver and his wife produced the Shaver Mystery Magazine irregularly for some years.

Rock books [ edit ]

During the 1960s and 1970s, now living in obscurity, Shaver searched for physical evidence of the bygone prehistoric races. He claimed to find it in certain rocks, which he believed were "rock books" that had been created by the great ancients and embedded with legible pictures and texts. For years he wrote about the rock books, photographed them and made paintings of the images he found in them to demonstrate their historic importance. He even ran a "rock book" lending library through the mail, sending a slice of polished agate with a detailed description of what writings, drawings and photographs he claimed were archived by Atlanteans inside the stone using special laser-like devices.

Shaver never succeeded in generating much attention for his later findings during his lifetime, but there have been exhibits of Shaver's art and photographs in the years since his death. Artist Brian Tucker created an exhibition about Shaver's life and work in 1989 at California Institute of the Arts, and presented Shaver's work again in later years at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Gallery of Chapman University in Orange County, California. In 2009, Tucker curated "Mantong and Protong", an exhibition at Pasadena City College which pairs Shaver's work with that of Stanislav Szukalski. Shaver's art has also been exhibited in galleries in New York City and in a traveling exhibition of "outsider photography" called "Create and Be Recognized" that originated at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco in 2004. In that exhibition, which toured the U.S., Shaver's "rock book" photography was grouped with works by famous "outsider artists", including Henry Darger and Adolf Wolfli.

Influence and references to the Shaver Mystery [ edit ]

After its initial effect on the Amazing Stories readership, the Shaver Mystery continued to influence science fiction and other general literature. Many modern books, movies, and games make references to Deros and other aspects of Shaver's story. The Shaver Mystery has also influenced believers of paranormal phenomena. This has taken various forms, from suspected connections between the Deros and UFOs to appearances of the Deros in the mythology of the Church of the Subgenius.

Shaver in science fiction, fantasy and horror [ edit ]

As noted above, writer Harlan Ellison reportedly thought the Shaver Mystery was nonsense. However, he did use elements of the Shaver Mystery in one of his own science fiction short stories. "From A to Z, in the Chocolate Alphabet" featured 26 brief stories, some a few pages long, others comprising only a few sentences. One story, "The Elevator People" reports that "[t]here are five hundred buildings in the United States whose elevators go deeper than the basement". Those unfortunates who descend to the caverns emerge nearly catatonic after being "treated" by the evil cavern inhabitants.[8]

The 2004 Japanese horror movie Marebito, directed by Takashi Shimizu, also references Shaver's work and the Deros. The movie references Shaver's books directly, as well as showing Deros at several times during the film.

Richard Shaver and the Deros are mentioned on a plaque in the video game Shivers, next to a sculpture of a Dero in the "Subterranean World" room.

Both Shaver and his work, as well as Amazing Stories, are amongst the esoteric and unusual ideas referred to in the Philip K. Dick novel Confessions of a Crap Artist.

In the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, which was heavily influenced by pulp and weird fiction in its development, there exists a race of evil subterranean dwarves called the derro, which were first described in the AD&D First Edition Monster Manual II. These derro make raids on the surface to kidnap humans for use as slaves and food, and some among them, called Savants, possess magical and psychic powers which they can use to influence people's minds. They are said to have a main stronghold deep underground where they plot the overthrow of humanity.

The novel Tamper, by Bill Ectric, takes its name from Shaver's description of the Deros' ability to tamper with the minds of humans with invisible rays. In the book, a boy obsessed with the "Shaver Mystery" begins to hear strange noises in his parents' basement, which may or may not be real.

Shaver and UFOs [ edit ]

In the summer of 1947, Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen some unusual flying objects near Mount Rainier. His report caused widespread interest in unidentified flying objects, and Palmer was quick to argue that the "flying saucers" were validation of the Shaver Mystery—for several years, he noted, Shaver had mentioned the Deros' supposed spaceships. The idea that Shaver and Palmer had somehow predicted or presaged the "flying saucer" craze was later championed by writer John Keel. His 1983 article "The Man Who Invented Flying Saucers" (first published in Fortean Times) declared that "Palmer assigned artists to make sketches of objects described by readers and disc-shaped flying machines appeared on the covers of his magazine long before June 1947. So we can note that a considerable number of people—millions—were exposed to the flying saucer concept before the national news media were even aware of it. Anyone who glanced at the magazines on a newsstand and caught a glimpse of the saucer-emblazoned Amazing Stories cover had the image implanted in his subconscious".

However, UFO researcher Jerome Clark would argue just the contrary, writing that "[i]t must be stressed that Palmer did not depict the deros' 'rockets' as disc shaped. Nonetheless in later years, some would insist, with more hyperbole than reason, that through Shaver's yarns Palmer 'invented flying saucers'. In fact, Palmer's influence beyond his relatively minuscule audience of science fiction fans and Forteans was nonexistent".[9]

Other influences [ edit ]

The poet-folklorist Jesse Glass joined Shaver's Atlantean Library in the early 1970s as a young man and briefly corresponded with him. He was intrigued by Shaver's "rock books" with their accompanying descriptions, but noted that sometimes the surfaces of the stones seemed to be treated in some manner. One piece of stone looked like the surface was actually a drawing or rubbing on paper that had been heavily shellacked or somehow glued on. In fact, bits of white paper seemed to be showing through the shellac. Glass corresponded with Shaver and found him to be an intelligent and well-read correspondent until one day, out of the blue, the letters took on an abusive tone. It was then that Glass ended the correspondence.

Artist Jermaine Rogers has often used his version of the Deros in his many posters used to advertise rock music concerts. Rogers has approached the subject of the Deros with an ambiguity that some have taken as proof that he truly believes in these beings. Starting in 1994, Rogers began including images of his Deros in several poster advertisements for rock and roll concerts. The Deros as depicted by Rogers are huge, 6 foot (2.8 meters) tall teddy bear-like beings, with leering grimaces and bulging red eyes. The artist has stated that this description is but one of the many "masks" the Deros are using to disguise themselves in their interactions with surface dwellers. Rogers has taken the general premise of the Deros and combined it with ancient legend and myth, fringe psychology, and his own personal interpretation. In Roger's telling, the subterranean world of the Deros is alive with strife, rebellion, and intrigue, wherein beings bred by Dero overlords (known as "Veil") have secretly conspired against them to foster their downfall. While Rogers discusses Shaver quite frequently, he nonetheless believes that Shaver's version of the story was overly exaggerated and that he was an unwitting pawn in the Deros plot.

"[Shaver] was fooled. The Deros ravaged his mind so often that much of what he says can't really be trusted. His ideas about the Deros became so fanciful and 'out there' that it became easy for skeptics to dismiss him as a nut. A fraud. There were no aliens. No rape and torture. That's all very fanciful and helped sell pulp magazines. The Deros have much more complicated goals than that. But Shaver's shouts of 'evil Deros!' distracted any reasonable authority from investigating Deros rationally. Shaver was disinformation."

Rogers' Dero has appeared in dozens of his rock and roll concert and art prints and in 2004 became a designer vinyl toy line.

Even then, because of seat belts and crush zones, cars were much safer than they had been in the early automotive age. The first decades of the automobile resulted in chaotic and unsafe driving conditions. Not only were the vehicles themselves dangerous to passengers and pedestrians (three quarters of early motoring related fatalities were pedestrians, often children), in the early days it was a free for all, with the first proposed traffic laws being instituted only after about a decade after the first automobiles. Author Bill Loomis is working on a book on Detroit history and in an extensive article in the Detroit News he discusses just how unsafe driving was a century ago, as well as the role that the Motor City had in making driving safer and less chaotic. Some of those innovations continue to make drivers safe, while others continue to annoy us.

Things we take for granted had to be implemented in the first place; even things as mundane as lane markings. The first centerline on a U.S. road was painted in Michigan in 1911. Before that, people would drive wherever they cared. Cars started to clog cities that weren’t designed with parking in mind, so people would park wherever they wanted to as well, sometimes in the middle of intersections or in front of fire hydrants. The city of Detroit started to use equipment designed to mark lines on tennis courts to paint lane dividers, crossings, safety zones and no parking zones, issuing citations to violators.

Traffic control devices, called Street Semaphores, were first implemented in Detroit. Developed by Cleveland inventor Garrett Morgan (who also invented the gas mask), they were manually operated red and green signs, later fitted with with red and green lights, controlled by a traffic patrolman in a crow’s next above the street. In the 1920s, the Street Semaphores were replaced with automatically operating stop lights, with the first automated traffic light being installed at the intersection of John R. St. and East Grand Blvd. in 1922. Around that time, a yellow light was added to the mix to alert drivers of an impending red light. (By the way, the motivation for switching to traffic lights wasn’t so much safety as saving money. The automated lights cost 10% of what it cost to man a Street Semaphore crow’s nest.)

To commemorate the Street Semaphores, Ferndale, Michigan installed a sculpture of one of the traffic crow’s nests near where one had been installed in 1920 at the intersection of Woodward Ave and Nine Mile Road. When Woodward was widened in 1928, that crow’s nest was replaced with an automated traffic light, but it was fondly remembered in Ferndale. Artist Shan Sutherland, who received his MFA in metalsmithing from the Detroit area Cranbrook Academy of Art, based his reproduction on historic photographs. The traffic signal is “manned” by a bust of a Ferndale police officer sculpted by Anne Sutherland, the artist’s mother.

Traffic lights weren’t the only traffic control device invented in Detroit. In 1911, the city was the first to implement one-way streets as a way of improving traffic flow and making commercial deliveries easier. The first stop sign in the United States was installed in Detroit a century ago in 1915. It had black letters against a white background. In the 1920s, the familiar octagon shape was standardized by national committees (though for decades stop signs were yellow, not changing to red until the 1950s).

Today, some states and cities have traffic lanes restricted to high occupancy vehicles or hybrid cars. That concept was presaged in the Motor City with an idea called “channelizing” streets, allowing only particular kinds of vehicles, like delivery vans or taxi cabs, on particular streets.

Detroit was the first city to have specific traffic cops, with a quarter of 1914’s thousand member Detroit Police Dept being assigned to traffic duty, and it was the second municipality, after New York City, to establish traffic courts.

Even with traffic cops and traffic courts, illegal parking continued to plague Detroit. James Couzens had been the business manager of the Ford Motor Company from its founding until he got sick and tired of working for Henry Ford in 1913. For a $10,000 investment in FoMoCo, Couzens was eventually paid $38 million. After he retired from Ford, he went into politics, first becoming Detroit mayor and then a U.S. senator. As mayor in 1917, Couzens proposed dealing with illegal parking with what he called “intensive disciplinary training”. Within half a year, the newly organized Detroit Towing Squad had towed almost 11,000 cars to a city owned vacant lot. Couzens, a pretty smart guy later said, “This proved to be something of a shock to the thoughtless and careless, but it proved effective.”

"Down inside this system, it is a death trap down there," said David McClure, president of Baltimore Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1300. "We have a lot of trash, food. The rats are feeding off that."

The 2,700-member union wants the MTA to adopt an abatement program similar to the city's. The city has introduced rat-resistant trash cans to curb the issue aboveground.

Workers encounter the rodents on the tracks, platforms and the escalators, McClure said. And even when they don't see them, he said, the stench can be nauseating and overwhelming.

"We have pictures of a rat that looks like a baby kangaroo," he said. "No one should have to come and work in these types of conditions. They have my members inside a booth and you have baby rats under the floorboards, [and] huge rats that have been running around in the stations."

Michael McMillan, a member of the union's executive board, said the lack of response demonstrates a lack of concern not only for members' well-being but for the public that uses the system.

"We have a grave concern for their health and safety," he said.

An MTA spokeswoman said the administration has received no customer complaints, and the union did not bring up rats during the collective bargaining that led to an agreement last month.

In a statement, spokeswoman Sandy Arnette said the MTA routinely exterminates pests at all of Baltimore's Metro stations, and enforces a "no-eating and no-drinking policy" for riders.

The stations are swept and mopped daily, the MTA said, and every two weeks, a nine-person crew scrubs floors, surfaces and windows, and removes trash from the tracks.

"It seems that today's publicity stunt is nothing more than an attempt for union leadership to solidify votes leading up to their elections next week," Arnette said.

A rat trap was set up next to the attendants' booth at the bottom of the escalators at the Mondawmin station Thursday.

A brief tour of the station revealed trash strewn below the tracks, a stairway black with filth and a rat scampering into a hole in a wall.

Jonetta Gunby-Woods, a resident of Park Heights, said she rides the bus and the subway at Mondawmin regularly and sees the rats all the time.

"They everywhere," Gunby-Woods said. "They running out the platform ... they go down the escalator. They running. I don't care what time of day it is."

McClure said union members met with MTA labor relations officials after the protest, and the groups agreed to visit the stations for a joint inspection.

But he isn't optimistic about any action beyond that.

"We're far from getting a resolution to this problem," McClure said.

If you have kids in school or have been vocal about your support for Donald Trump, you need to be aware that there are a number of groups calling for targeted attacks and killings of those who supported, voted for, or voice their support for our new President.

At schools throughout the country, kids who have voiced their support for our new President are being targeted in vicious attacks and acts of intimidation. In a racially charged attack at a school in Woodside California, a female student was viciously beaten by a group of thugs after she voiced support for Donald Trump.

The family told KTVU, the female student had expressed support for Donald Trump on her Instagram account on the night of the election saying “I hope he wins.” During a break at school the following day, the student says she was randomly attacked. The girl’s father said the attack against his daughter was politically motivated.

11-Yr-Old Boy Attacked at School & Put in Crutches for Voting Trump in Mock Election

In Stanford, Texas, an 11-yesr old boy was savagely attacked inside his classroom after telling students that he voted for Donald Trump in the classroom’s mock election.

“This is America,” said Mary Lemmon, the mother of the student beaten. “Everyone has the right to their own opinion, and they shouldn’t be beat up for it.” But just a day after Donald Trump was elected President, that’s exactly what happened to her son at Stafford Elementary School. “These boys decided to ask the classroom, ‘Who voted for Donald Trump?’ And then I said, ‘I did.’ And then they come over here and jerked me out of my seat,” said the student. “Before I could get up they started kicking me and punching me.” Lemmon said her son has deep bruises throughout his body and is now on crutches.

Pulling People from their Cars…

In Chicago, a man was viciously beaten by a group of thugs who was targeting Donald Trump supporters, or whites who they assumed automatically voted for Trump because of their skin color. The domestic terrorists uploaded their attack to the internet, with a rap track that many of these people are using to push their violent agenda of intimidation.

I warn you the video is disturbing and contains some offensive music.

While little known to the masses, the CSB is to chemical disasters what the much better-funded National Transportation Safety Board is to airline crashes, train derailments and bridge collapses. Without the recommendations that come from these boards, preventable accidents repeat themselves.

Gutting the CSB is "standing up for death and destruction," said chemical safety consultant Paul Orum. "It's disrespectful to those killed in such incidents."

A Houston Chronicle investigation last year found that federal agencies, including the CSB, don't have enough resources to provide adequate oversight to facilities that handle dangerous chemicals.

Three of the most far-reaching investigations in the history of chemical safety resulted from the CSB.

Enhancing safety

In 2005, a unit at BP's Texas City refinery overfilled with hydrocarbons, releasing a massive cloud of liquid and gas that exploded, killing 15 and injuring more than 180.

Just as important as the agency's causal findings was its recommendation that BP launch an independent examination of its corporate safety culture. Together, these two reports rippled through an industry that had long harped on worker safety, like preventing falls and wearing the right equipment, to the detriment of process safety - designing and monitoring chemical and refining units to prevent releases and explosions.

"It's a seminal investigation," said CSB Chairwoman Vanessa Allen Sutherland. "The lessons ... are frequently cited and discussed, and it was 10 years ago."

They've been incorporated into academic curriculums, industry technical standards and corporate behavior, and triggered a massive emphasis on refinery safety by the Labor Department.

No specifics given

Then in 2010, BP's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico blew out, leading to an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 people, injured 17 and caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history. CSB findings in 2016 showed gaping holes in offshore safety and regulatory oversight that hadn't been addressed despite numerous earlier investigations and lawsuits.

The disaster cost BP more than $60 billion - some of which could be subsidized by taxpayers. By contrast, the CSB budget is about $12 million annually, or one thousandth of 1 percent of the $1.1 trillion that President Trump proposes spending.

Chemical Breakdown: Read our series on chemical dangers in Texas

So while it's difficult to prove any one disaster has been prevented by the agency, stopping just one could justify the cost of the CSB since its inception in 1998, said Mike Wright, director of safety for the United Steelworkers union.

"We think it's a remarkably stupid move" to kill the agency, Wright said. "The CSB is probably one of the best deals in Washington in terms of spending the taxpayer's money."

It's also the only agency that investigates chemical accidents without companies having to worry about fines or indictments. That's because its focus is finding root causes and lessons that can be shared across industries. And it examines the failings of regulators.

The CSB was given no specific indication why it was targeted, Sutherland said, though it falls in line with the president's pledge to cut broadly to pay for a beefed-up military and border protection.

The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

It was unclear where industry stands. The two major trade associations, the American Chemistry Council and the American Petroleum Institute, offered statements that didn't directly address the merits of eliminating the CSB.

Shakeel Kadri, executive director of the Center for Chemical Process Safety, a division of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, said his group supports the CSB and says the agency's independent investigations are critical.

"We can't do that. I don't see anyone else being able to do that, either," he said.

It's widely believed the overall budget proposal was dead on arrival at the Capitol, as even Republicans blanched at what was and wasn't being cut.

"I think the Trump budget is a fantasy," said Rep. Gene Green, a Democrat whose district includes much of Houston's heavy industry. "I don't think so much of it will ever be considered."

That doesn't mean the CSB will survive unscathed. Among its 40 employees, some were already privately assuming that Congress would significantly scale back the agency this year. And, as a measure of the administration's priorities, Thursday's proposal was an exclamation point on a flurry of activity aimed at rolling back worker and chemical safety regulations.

A 'really sad matter'

On Monday, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt acceded to industry demands by agreeing to delay and reconsider implementation of Obama-era rules that came as a direct result of the 2013 West Fertilizer disaster. It killed 15 people, including 12 first-responders who rushed to a fire at the plant before it exploded.

Sutherland said the resulting CSB investigation was another of the agency's most important, exposing major gaps in emergency planning and response across the nation.

In agreeing to delay the rules, and perhaps scrap them altogether, Pruitt accepted the industry's argument that, because investigators last year ruled the West fire an arson, it renders them moot.

But the arson ruling has no bearing on other factors in the explosion, Sutherland said. Had the fertilizer been stored differently, had first-responders received training on the well-known explosion hazards of ammonium nitrate, had the town not grown perilously close to the plant over the years, much of the death and destruction would have been averted.

Republican lawmakers already have introduced a bill that could roll back the Obama regulations, should the EPA not take up the task.

At least 46 people have died in U.S. chemical plants since West.

Sam Mannan, director of the Mary Kay O'Connor Process Safety Center at Texas A&M University, called elimination of the CSB a "really sad matter."

"Everyone uses the CSB's videos and reports," he said.

Orum, the consultant, noted the gap between congressional authorization of the CSB in 1990, and its actual funding in 1998. The budget argument was that OSHA and EPA could handle chemical accident investigations. But they weren't as thorough, and industry preferred the CSB, because it didn't come in looking for violations, Orum said.

He expects "cooler heads" in Congress.

"Chemical incidents are highly visible when they happen," he said. "There's smoke, flames and news cameras. If it looks like they've undermined safety, it could come back to bite them."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0279091-8bd89762c6e3edadb9659dade4d292e9.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003442 00000000000 015376  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is in Asia this week for a weeklong tour. Panetta warns on China, N. Korea

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Monday that China’s growing military demonstrates a “troubling lack of transparency” and is being “increasingly assertive” in the region.

“China is rapidly modernizing its military but with a troubling lack of transparency, coupled with increasingly assertive activity in the East and South China Seas,” Panetta wrote in an op-ed in Japan’s Yomiyuri newspaper, the Associated Press reports.

Panetta wrote that the United States and Japan will work together to “encourage China to play a responsible role in the international community,” the wire said.

The defense secretary is in Asia this week for a weeklong tour through Indonesia, Japan and South Korea.

In the op-ed in Yomiyuri, Panetta also sounded an alarm bell over North Korea, saying that Pyongyang “continues to engage in reckless and provocative behavior and is developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which pose a threat not just to Japan but to the entire region,” according to the AP.

The comments come as American and North Korean officials engage in talks this week about Pyongyang’s nuclear program in Geneva.

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Monday that in these ongoing meetings, the U.S. is following up on the issues that were discussed with Pyongyang earlier this year.

“In July, we gave the North Koreans a specific set of initiatives that we’d like to see to demonstrate that they are prepared to take concrete steps to meet their denuclearization obligations,” Nuland told reporters. “We also asked at that time that North-South dialogue be resumed so I think we will … be following up on all of those things.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0279013-8e972c5fc5322f08f8a52d0160db72dc.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003344 00000000000 015115  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Nendoroid Sayaka Miki School Uniform Ver. and Kyouko Sakura Casual Clothes Ver.

He went to to completely obliterate Florida Congresswoman Wilson for trying to politicize such a heartbreaking event.

Obviously, John Kelly has a personal relation to events such as these, as his own son was killed in action during Obama’s presidency.

“When I listened to this woman, what she was saying, what she was doing on tv, the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go walk among the finest men and women among this earth. You can always find them, because they’re in Arlington National Cemetery. “

Kelly ends his speech (9:00 in the video below) with a short story of a dedication of a new FBI field office in Miami in April 2015. The office was dedicated to two brave FBI members killed in a previous gunfight. According to Kelly, when congresswoman Wilson stood up to speak, all that she talked about was how she was the one who got the funding for the building.

Kelly refers to this woman as an “empty barrel,” but reminds America that none of them went to the press or criticized her publicly. They simply ignored her selfish behavior, like the professionals they are.

Words are not powerful enough to describe Kelly’s recollections. You’ll need to watch this moving moment by John Kelly below:

SHARE this everywhere so everyone can see how DIRTY the Democrats play!                                                                   0279053-ffd3efc9de539d937422b1cea6d66751.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010623 00000000000 015300  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Five years ago, my family left all our possessions in a shed at the other end of the world and arrived at an inner-city apartment with nothing but some clothes. Needless to say, for quite a while family friendly entertainment was hard to come by. One of the saving graces was the gift of a board game: Ticket to Ride. The game has become a family staple—it's challenging but not unwinnable for the older children, and entertaining for the adults.

Now, the Days of Wonder team have put together a $6.99 iPad version of the game. When the Ars editors were looking for a reviewer with Ben out of town, I had the happy combination of an iPad and familiarity with the board game. The physical game means a lot to me, so I viewed a software version with some trepidation.

Playing the game

For those of you not familiar with the game, here's a quick recap. Ticket to Ride is a railway track-building game, where you collect cards that allow you to lay track between cities on a map—there are regionalized versions, but I have only played the North American version. For each card that you play, you get differing points depending on the length of the track. The twist that makes it work is the route cards: each player has certain pairs of cities that they must connect. Do so and you obtain extra points, failure results in those points being subtracted from your final score.

With a limited amount of track available and various restrictions to the number of tracks that can be laid between adjacent cities, the game quickly becomes an ever-changing mathematical puzzle that will challenge everyone.

The iPad version of Ticket to Ride impresses right from the beginning. The play is directly translated from the board game. The cards and board have the same color and design, and the touchscreen is used to great effect: you pick up cards from the deck and place cards on track locations to lay track. When you complete a route, the game goes through a celebratory routine that leaves you in no doubt as to the brilliance of your accomplishment. The only downside is that the AI players go so fast that you can't keep track of what cards have been selected from the open choices. It is also hard to keep track of how many trains you and everyone else have left, since it is one of four numbers associated with each player.

The AI isn't great. The computer just seems to select one route after another and complete them. Young children do the same, but I would have expected the developers to have programmed some more nuanced strategies. Indeed, the in-game tutorial does an excellent job of teaching the mechanics of the game, but leaves the impression that completing routes sequentially is the best strategy to employ.

Network play

Clearly, Days of Wonder wants you on the 'Net, playing against other players. So I decided to make my online gaming debut and chose network play. After choosing the number of players you want to play against, you wait for a while and then some random Internet dudes gets matched up with you. The gameplay is the same, but the cards move a bit slower, so you can track what the other players are doing a bit better. The in-game chat turned out to be a tiny little speech bubble attached to your player's avatar, but, even with that, the whole experience was a bit... cold. A bit of a downer: when I play games, I want to play with friends. I should note that there is a train station restaurant where you can meet players and arrange games with people you know.

Luckily, Chris Foresman volunteered to be my friend for a day, and off we went. We discovered that the game is a little flaky in network play. The game crashed once and the server booted us a few times. It seems that the timeout period is quite short, so if you get interrupted, expect a bot to take your seat at the table.

Finally, the in-game chat is rudimentary at best. Chat messages show up in speech bubbles that stay on screen for about a nanosecond. If you notice the message, you won't necessarily be able to read it because they make up the lack of longevity by cutting off long messages. I have to say that went a long way to making a great game suck.

Get to the point: is it good or bad?

I love Ticket to Ride and I love the way the iPad version is laid out. Days of Wonder has come up with a fabulous ragtime theme from the end of the steam era. As a standalone game this is a good time, but it's not replacement for the board game, with its more social experience.

Verdict: Buy                                                                                                             0279097-1c1625987f8707e8d090b72fefca77c3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000024532 00000000000 015076  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        It’s time to say goodbye to Joe Louis Arena, home of the Detroit Red Wings since 1979. Here are 19 reasons (in honor of Steve Yzerman) we’ll always remember The Joe.

1. Yzerman’s Double-Overtime Goal in Game Seven

The greatest moment in the history of The Joe was supplied by the greatest player to skate there. Yzerman’s 60-foot game-winning slap shot not only propelled the Wings to the Conference Finals, it triggered an eruption of joy in the building. The play featured three all-time greats: Yzerman, the Blues’ Wayne Gretzky (who gives a half-hearted effort on defense), and Slava Fetisov. The game featured 14 future Hall of Famers and remains an iconic moment in Detroit sports lore. The call, by Gary Thorne, is one of the best in NHL history.

2. Gordie’s return for the 1980 NHL All-Star Game

When Gordie Howe came to Detroit’s new Joe Louis Arena to play in the 1980 NHL All-Star Game for the Hartford Whalers, the former Red Wing was 52. But he was still lacing up his skates, passing the puck with his deft touch, and swinging his elbows when needed. He didn’t go to the All-Star Game as a sentimental favorite, he was still an impact player on the ice.

Detroit lost Gordie nearly a decade earlier when he first retired. But now they knew #9 would soon be hanging up his skates for good. The ovation Howe received during player inductions is spine-tinglingly awesome.

3. Fight Night

Championship seasons often turn on one key game, and so it was when the Red Wings finally snapped their 42-year Stanley Cup drought in the spring of 1997. “It becomes clearer with each passing night,” a Denver sportswriter observed during that year’s conference finals between Detroit and Colorado, “that the evening of March 26, 1997 changed the psychological dynamics of hockey’s most heated rivalry.”

The reporter was referring to “Fight Night at The Joe,” an awesome display of primal rage that unified a team in transition and served notice that this particular edition of Scotty Bowman’s team was not going to be shoved around, least of all by the Avalanche. The fights that took place that evening on the ice between the rivals were an exorcism of sorts for the Wings, who were poised to be champions.

4. The Russian Five

For two seasons in the mid-1990s, the Red Wings had five former members of the Russian Red Army team, five of the best skaters and hockey players in the world. In a rare move for the NHL, coach Scotty Bowman used the five together in two-minute shifts, playing not only the three-man line of Igor Larionov, Vyacheslav Kozlov and Sergei Fedorov, but also Vladimir Konstantinov and Viacheslav Fetisov on defense.

In their first year together, the team won the Stanley Cup in their second season together. Sadly, six days after that Cup victory, Konstantinov was paralyzed after the limousine he was traveling in was in a horrible accident. The Russian Five were short-lived, but while they were together they transformed team play in the NHL.

5. Fedorov’s five-goal game

You have to watch it to believe it really happened.

6. Hoisting The Cup…finally

Twenty years ago, on June 7, 1997, the Wings finally snapped their Stanley Cup drought when they defeated the Flyers 2-1 in Game Four of the Finals. It completed a four-game sweep and gave Detroit their first Stanley Cup championship in 42 years.

7. Bowman behind the bench

For nine seasons from 1993 to 2002, the Red Wings had the greatest hockey coach in history behind their bench. The stone-faced Scotty led Detroit to four Stanley Cup Finals, winning three times. He was known for “the chin” and his active method of coaching his players (he enjoyed strapping on the skates to instruct his team). In Detroit he melded a group of young in-their-prime players with veteran superstars and took that group and mixed them with five international legends from Russia. His teams set records for most points and wins in a season, and his final team, the 2001-02 squad, featured nine future Hall of Famers and is considered one of the greatest teams in history. In all, Bowman won nine Stanley Cups, three with Detroit and his teams clinched two of them on the ice at The Joe.

8. Octopus on the ice

It’s the slimiest tradition in sports and it’s all Detroit. Eight tentacles equal the eight wins it used to take to win the Cup. Detroit (and The Joe) was the only place it made sense.

9. The crazy bounces off the boards

It was frustrating for visiting players. Sometimes it was frustrating to Red Wing players. But it always made things interesting. The quirky wooden boards at The Joe made the puck do bizarre things at times. One famous bounce sent the puck into the goal against the Sabres from 45 feet away.

10. The voice of Budd Lynch

The Joe was not a perfect building, in fact a lot of people felt it was less than desirable. Some even called the place “a dump.” It could be damp, cold, noisy, and in later years it often had a strange odor. It was quirky for sure. But public address announcer Budd Lynch gave it a fantastic soundtrack. He handled every game at The Joe from 1985 through the 2011-12 season.

11. After-game drinks at Cicarelli’s

Originally called “The Post,” this local bar near Joe Louis Arena is the best place to celebrate (or drink away) the results of the hockey game. It’s also a frequent hangout for players and coaches.

12. The repeat

It was with heavy hearts that the Wings raised the 1996-97 Stanley Cup Championship banner as the 1997-98 season started at The Joe. Vladimir Konstantinov and other members of the Red Wing family had suffered injuries in an automobile accident after their victory. Vlad would never play again. In tribute to him, the team wore “Believe” patches during the 1997-98 season. With Sergei Fedorov, Brendan Shanahan, and captain Steve Yzerman leading the way, Detroit repeated as champions. It’s the last time an NHL team has won back-to-back titles.

13. The Perfect Human

Nicklas Lidstrom played his entire 20-year career for Detroit, his home games at The Joe. Widely regarded as the greatest defenseman in NHL history, the Swede won the James Norris Memorial Trophy a record seven times and won four Stanley Cup titles in the Motor City. After Yzerman’s retirement, Lidstrom succeeded #19 as team captain.

14. Mr. I on the ice with his team

Four times since 1997 the Red Wings made the city of Detroit proud by winning the Stanley Cup title. Four times they gave their passionate fans something to scream about. No fan was as proud as owner Mike Ilitch, who gave the franchise every advantage in their pursuit of greatness. Ilitch changed the way NHL owners spent money, as the Detroit pizza and entertainment magnate broke out his checkbook to lure the greatest players to Motown. He transformed Detroit into “Hockeytown,” the envy of every NHL city in the league. Three times, Mr. I was able to see his wings clinch the Cup at The Joe, and each time he made his way to the ice to celebrate.

15. Isiah’s scoring binge in the 1984 NBA Playoffs

The Detroit Pistons played only one game at The Joe, but it was unforgettable for the historic performances that took place by the two biggest stars on the court. Due to a scheduling conflict at the Silverdome, the Pistons played deciding Game Five of their playoff series against the Knicks at The Joe on April 27, 1984. With 94 seconds left in the game and the Pistons trailing by ten points, Isiah Thomas went to another place. A higher level. The Detroit guard scored 16 points in 1:34 and sent the game into overtime. The Pistons lost when New York guard Bernard King had the game of his life, responding to Isiah’s historic performance.

16. The puck-handling of Zäta

As the Wings prepare to leave The Joe, the last link to their great dynastic era is Henrik Zzetterberg, the 36-year old veteran forward who was the MVP of the Stanley Cup Playoffs in 2008. That was the last time the Wings hoisted The Cup. “Hank” will be a Hall of Famer someday on the strength of his dazzling puck-handling skills. He’s one of the best passers to ever wear the Detroit sweater.

17. The enforcers

Detroit is a working-class, blue-collar city. Fans respond to tough, hardnosed play. Nothing has exemplified that more than the play of Detroit enforcers like Darren McCarty, Joey Kocur, Reed Larson, Brendan Shanahan, and the ultimate tough guy, Bob Probert. In nine seasons with Detroit, Probert amassed more than 3,300 penalty minutes, the fifth-highest total in NHL history. He was big, fearless, and nearly undefeated with his fists.

18. The greatest team of all-time

The 2001-02 Red Wings were loaded. They had “The Captain,” Steve Yzerman, the game’s best defenseman in Nicklas Lidstrom, the most feared goalie in the NHL in “The Dominator” Dominik Hasek, and several other future Hall of Famers. They were guided by the legend, Scorry Bowman, an eight-time Stanley Cup champion. This was the best team money could buy, and Mike Ilitch gladly wrote all the checks. The team was so deep they had former All-Stars fighting to get playing time. Two months into the season, the Wings were 22-3-1 and people were talking about them winning 70 games. They leveled off, but they won eight of nine games to dispatch the Canucks and Blues in the first two rounds of the playoffs. They met the Avalanche, the reigning champions, in the Western Conference Finals. Led by the play of goalie Patrick Roy, Colorado took a 3-2 series lead, winning three times in overtime. The Wings won a tense Game Six in Colorado to force a deciding Game Seven back in Detroit at The Joe. The outcome was never in doubt. The superior Wings scored on five of their first seven shots to take a 5-0 lead with nearly half of the first period still left to play. Roy was dazed, confused, and embarrassed. He was eventually pulled from the game, which Detroit won 7-0 to advance. Thirteen days later the Red Wings finished off the Hurricanes to win the Stanley Cup. The greatest team ever (according to many) had led wire-to-wire and captured a third title for Bowman in Detroit. After the game, the Detroit coach announced his retirement.

19. The rafters

Yes, the team will bring the famed banners from The Joe to their new home at Little Caesar’s Arena. All of the red banners, the retired numbers, the Cup titles, the Conference titles, the playoff series appearances, they will all be back at the top of the new building. But it can’t seem as historic as it did at The Joe. It just can’t.

Jinder Mahal recently shocked the wrestling world by becoming the WWE World Champion. He's the latest in a long line of foreign wrestlers offering a blunt critique of American supremacy.

NOEL KING, HOST:

There's a brand new bad guy in the world of pro wrestling, a world that thrives off of being provocative. Reporter Arun Venugopal of member station WNYC has more on the wrestler who wears a turban and hates America.

ARUN VENUGOPAL, BYLINE: The wrestling world was shocked - shocked - when Jinder Mahal became WWE champion in May, but not these guys.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATORS: Number one. Number one. Number one. India number one.

VENUGOPAL: Those are the WWE's Hindi-language commentators. Jinder Mahal, the Maharaja, is of Indian descent, as his name may suggest. He is physically enormous and just mean.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JINDER MAHAL: Randy Orton is just like all of you. He's just like America. He's on the decline.

VENUGOPAL: The crowd boos and shouts U-S-A because unlike the guy he beat, Randy Orton of Tennessee, Jinder Mahal's from a foreign place, meaning Calgary. Yeah, he's actually Canadian, but he wears a turban, and he gloats in another language.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MAHAL: (Foreign language spoken).

VENUGOPAL: Punjabi. In the parlance of pro wrestling, Jinder is a heel, a bad guy. Dion Beary is a writer and wrestling fan and has been closely following Jinder's ascent.

DION BEARY: He is really good at digging into America is losing its spot as the leader of the world.

VENUGOPAL: To China and to India. But it's all for the best, you see, because...

BEARY: At some point, the American cowboy is going to ride in and take our wrestling back from the foreigner.

VENUGOPAL: Foreign heels have been around forever. There was Abdullah the Butcher aka the Madman from Sudan. But occasionally things have spiraled out of control. Take the story line about an Arab-American character, Muhammad Hassan. In one match, Hassan joined a bunch of masked men - basically, Middle Eastern extremists - as they beat his opponent and choked him until he was unconscious.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: What the hell is going on here?

VENUGOPAL: That episode's still shocking and aired in 2005, the same day a series of suicide bomb attacks went off in London in real life. Muhammad Hassan's character was quickly disappeared. Jinder Mahal thinks it's best not to take wrestling too seriously.

MAHAL: People know what we do is just entertainment.

VENUGOPAL: I caught him on one of his off days.

MAHAL: While you're a WWE program, you can forget about your real-life problems and whatnot.

VENUGOPAL: And even, he says, gain some cultural exposure on the way. There have been real, live bhangra dancers at his events and music.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Anybody selling tickets?

VENUGOPAL: Tonight, Jinder's defending his title in Rochester at the Blue Cross Arena. I asked fans what they make of him. This is Todd Eardman.

TODD EARDMAN: I have to be blunt, it's the brown storyline. If you need controversy, give a brown guy a belt and, oh, you don't like me because I'm this. No, we don't like you 'cause we don't like you. You're not that good (laughter).

VENUGOPAL: Inside, I grab some beer and fries and a bowl of Dippin' Dots. Jinder's facing off against Mojo Rawley, and he's in serious trouble.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: And Mahal scrambles to the bottom rope here in...

VENUGOPAL: But then, something miraculous happens.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: And look at Mahal - right across the eyes.

VENUGOPAL: Jinder comes from behind and...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: Oh, and the coloss (ph) from Mahal finishes off Rawley.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

VENUGOPAL: And he wins. The Maharaja triumphs yet again, and America must lick its wounds. Of course, for some fans, it's more complicated than us versus them. Rashad Fulton is Muslim and brought his kids.

RASHAD FULTON: Once they become aware, then it's a conversation to be had.

VENUGOPAL: What's the conversation to be had?

FULTON: That - what they're selling, good versus bad. There's no good and bad. It's politics. Because on our side, we think that we are the good guys, but in all honesty, we may be the wrong ones.

He then responded to her question about how the U.S. would respond to Russia. (The Washington Post)

President Trump had successfully navigated Monday’s joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, a delicate affair that required him to balance just-completed diplomatic talks with the latest news about Hurricane Harvey, as well as public interest in his recent pardon of Joe Arpaio.

Then Trump started freelancing.

Joint news conferences with foreign leaders typically follow a short, rigid format: two questions for U.S. journalists and two for reporters from the home country of the president’s counterpart. Thirteen times before, Trump has adhered to this structure.

On Monday, however, Trump decided to keep rolling, after getting through the standard four inquiries.

“I know there might be a couple of more questions,” he said, turning to Niinisto. “Do you want to take one more? Would you want to take one more? Go ahead. Pick.”

A visibly surprised Niinisto obliged and gestured to a third Finnish journalist. “Please,” he said.

“Again?” said Trump, mistaking the woman for another female reporter who had asked a question earlier in the news conference. “You’re gonna give her — the same one?”

“No, she is not the same lady,” Niinistö replied. “They are sitting side by side.”

“We have a lot of blond women in Finland,” the reporter interjected.

True enough. And as presidential gaffes go, this was pretty minor.

Then again, it is always politically inadvisable to suggest that all (insert historically marginalized demographic group here) look the same. This principle certainly applies to Trump, a magnet for charges of sexism and racism.

Just a couple of months ago, during an Oval Office conference with reporters, Trump called an Irish female journalist over to his desk and told Ireland’s newly elected prime minister, who was on the phone, that the journalist “has a nice smile on her face. So, I bet she treats you well.”

That was an improvised moment, too — the kind that surely makes White House advisers cringe.

When Trump sticks to a plan, he can deliver a solid performance, as he did for most of Monday’s news conference. But when he ad-libs, he might suggest that a female reporter’s smile indicates soft coverage or reveals that he can’t be bothered to tell the difference between two women with the same hair color.                                        0279125-53a506bb3fb75be0c9da38189ac69be9.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006611 00000000000 015267  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Hoffman Estates cafe staffed by adults with Down syndrome

Officials with GiGi's Playhouse in Hoffman Estates describe their Hugs + Mugs cafe as one of the only stores of its kind to be totally staffed and run by adults with Down syndrome.

And that's the appeal. The atmosphere is friendly -- and hugs are free.

"We think it's one of the best kept secrets in the Northwest suburbs," says Dave Luzwick, director of adult programming and job placement.

Hugs + Mugs opened three years ago and word is getting out. On a typical day, Luzwick says, they may serve between 40-50 cups of coffee while, in a design studio tucked away in the back, interns create many of their custom gifts that are sold through the shop and online.

Depending on the time of day, the shop also sells milkshakes, smoothies and seven flavors of gelato, all of which are big sellers.

The cafe is part of a multipronged approach of GiGi's Playhouse, which describes itself as an "achievement center" for individuals with Down syndrome and their families. One step into the playhouse itself reflects the center's warm, vibrant approach, with its array of colorful toys, books and even murals.

Programming in both small and large classrooms ranges from prenatal support and classes for early learners, up to literacy and math tutoring, speech therapy, fitness classes and social groups.

Those young adults who work in the cafe start out in GiGi U first, attending two, 12-week sessions. Sitting in a classroom located in the back of the playhouse, students study literacy and math, as well as public speaking, fitness, and health and wellness.

After completing their sessions, students can begin an 18-week internship working in the cafe while they transition into working at a job in the community.

Some, like Kiera Breault, 35, of Palatine -- who works for the Nelson Group Hair Salon in Palatine -- likes helping out in the cafe so much, she keeps coming back.

"It's important to have good customer service," Kiera says, before reciting the motto behind "Generation G." "Be accepting, be generous, be kind."

Another veteran is Samir Dadrowski, 26, of Mount Prospect. He now divides his time between working for the Niles Park District and the cafe, while Jenny Pavnik, 32, of Inverness works at the Jewel-Osco in Barrington when she's not at the cafe.

"I like to count the money and make change," Jenny says, "and helping customers."

Creating gifts is the main appeal to Christine Maxwell, 40, a native of South Barrington now living in her own apartment in Evanston. She comes out every weekend to work at the cafe, both as a mentor to younger employees and to design artwork to decorate gifts.

Interns use a heat press machine to imprint her images on cards, T-shirts, water bottles and key chains.

"They like my drawing and they ask me to do it for all the holidays," says Christine, a multisport athlete in Special Olympics and an ambassador with the Global Messenger initiative. "For me, it's like my own gallery."                                                                                                                       0279037-f9d3dfef4f37ca64a3fefd3f9f9b27b6.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012123 00000000000 015607  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In view of the devastation inflicted on the Tory party by the gay-marriage issue, it is remarkable how little interest has been shown in the story that lies behind David Cameron’s desperation to get a measure – that was not mentioned in his 2010 election manifesto – on to the statute book by no later than June this year.

As I recounted here on February 9, the drive to get same-sex marriage into law was masterminded from 2010 onwards by an alliance between Theresa May, the Conservative Home Secretary, Lynne Featherstone, the Lib Dem equalities minister, and gay pressure groups, led by one called Equal Love. They pushed the issue forward, not in Westminster, but through the Council of Europe, culminating in March last year with a day-long “secret conference” chaired by Miss Featherstone in Strasbourg. With the public excluded for the first time in the Council’s history, it was here that – with the active support of Sir Nicolas Bratza, the British president of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) – a deadline was set for their planned coup of June 2013. If, by this date, “several countries” had managed to put gay marriage into law, Sir Nicolas pledged that his court would then declare same-sex marriage to be a Europe-wide human right. Hence the recent rush for several countries to oblige, including France, where gay marriage has brought thousands of protesters out on to the streets. And hence last Tuesday’s unprecedented revolt in the House of Commons, when 133 Tories voted against their government.

They included Owen Paterson, the only Cabinet minister to vote for all the amendments moved by his parliamentary private secretary, David Burrowes, designed to give protection from intolerance to those opposed to same-sex marriage for reasons of conscience or principle.

An irony of all this was that among the amendments defeated by the Government was one proposing that heterosexuals should be given an equal right to homosexuals to enter into civil partnerships.Originally, in 2010, Theresa May had been all for this, as was Equal Love, which supported a case by eight gay and non-gay couples to be taken to the ECHR. But when the Government checked the financial implications of allowing non-gay couples to enjoy civil partnerships, finding that the resulting tax privileges could cost the Treasury up to £4 billion a year, it ruled that this was a step it couldn’t afford. When it comes to equality, it seems that money takes precedence – and that some people must be considered more equal than others.

In March, we are now told (although it was reported here at the time), Britain came within hours of running out of gas and facing enormous power cuts. Meanwhile, almost wholly unnoticed by the British media, there were signs last week of a mighty earthquake beginning to take place in the EU’s energy policy.

For 20 years, as we know, this has been hijacked by the EU’s fixation with climate change. But at Wednesday’s meeting of the European Council, there were, at last, indications that many countries now recognise that the EU’s bid to lead the world in “de-carbonising” is leading the European economy towards meltdown. They have finally cottoned on to the fact that, in recent years, while energy prices in Europe have been doubling, those in the US, thanks to the shale gas revolution, have halved.

Thanks to the demonising of fossil fuels, the obsession with windmills and ever-rising taxes on any economic activity that emits CO₂, European countries have been alarmed to see ever more European firms being forced either to move their operations outside the EU, or to shut down altogether (as we saw here in Britain recently with the closure of our last remaining major aluminium smelter, at the cost of 500 jobs).

Astonishingly, even that great greenie David Cameron told journalists in Brussels that, with the US now deriving 30 per cent of its energy from shale, and Europeans now having “to pay twice what Americans pay for wholesale gas”, Britain and Europe must now work flat-out to exploit their own vast shale gas reserves. “Unnecessary regulation,” he insisted, “must not stand in the way.”

The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, whose brother-in-law Lord (Matt) Ridley is our leading parliamentary enthusiast for shale gas, is already clearing the regulatory decks for shale gas drilling in Britain to go ahead as soon as possible.

Mr Cameron, like other EU leaders, still paid lip service to the need to “meet our carbon targets” (shale gas being a fossil fuel). But, unmistakably, the tectonic plates are at last beginning to shift under an EU energy policy that for too long has imprisoned us on a course that could only land Europe’s economies in an even more disastrous and uncompetitive mess than they are in already.

What happened last week could prove to be a unique example in the EU’s history of it recognising that it has made such a catastrophic blunder that its policy must change.

But so boring do we consider pretty well anything the EU does that almost nobody in Britain – apart from the admirable Global Warming Policy Foundation – seems to have noticed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279176-63e21ee4b5496ac5e57d259c0e8e2fe5.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005576 00000000000 015235  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A CAT killer has been caged for 16 years after stealing and sexually abusing neighbourhood furries.

Robert Farmer was convicted of animal cruelty after a spate of distressed neighbours reported their fluffy friends mysteriously disappearing. Many of his 21 victims turned up in rubbish bins and shoeboxes – and one dead cat had been sexually abused. Residents tipped off police after seeing CCTV showing Farmer crouching in a driveway before scooping up one elderly tabby and running off with him.

Dear Peter Dunne, S.O.S. | 500 Words

An open letter to Peter Dunne MP from Scoop Editor Alastair Thompson

Dear Peter,

When I first heard the news that you might have leaked the Kitteridge Report into the GCSB my personal assessment of you rose greatly. It was a report that was begging to be leaked. And whoever did leak it ought to be congratulated.

When you later confirmed (at your resignation press conference) that you had indeed discussed leaking the report with Andrea Vance but decided not to do so, I felt vindicated for this view. Nevertheless I now take you at your word that you did not in fact leak the report.

And in the absence of evidence to the contrary - legally obtained - the PM ought to have done the same thing.

For the record I also think it was very unfortunate the manner in which you were treated by the opposition over this matter. Their initial demands for an investigation into your conduct and for the release of your emails were poorly thought out and cruelly pursued.

The fact that all this coincided with the party membership recognition issues - which resulted in leaving you isolated was also very unfortunate.

Meanwhile the public opprobrium that you have recently been receiving on twitter - whilst understandable on one level, people are angry at their perceived loss of liberty- is also unfortunate and does not reflect an understanding of the position you currently find yourself in.







However I think that since adopting you I am beginning to do so.

Over the weekend I reached out to you and suggested you open a line of communication with Kim Dotcom @kimdotcom via Twitter direct messaging.

I sincerely hope that you did so as I think that you two have a lot in common.

The Megaupload Four - Kim Dotcom, Bram van der Kolk , Mathias Ortman and Finn Batato - were to my mind the first known victims of GCSB over-reach.

And in my opinion yourself and my press gallery colleague Andrea Vance were the second.

Yes I know that you have repeatedly said that you believe there is "no connection" between the GCSB illegal spying allegations and what happened to you and Andrea Vance.

And you are right that the agent of spying was different - i.e. it was Parliament Services and their contractors Datacom.

But to say there is "no connection" between the two is - I think - overstating the case.

If you will please indulge me for a moment, I would like to explain why I think this is so.

1. The GCSB inquiry by Rebecca Kitteridge was sparked by the illegal spying on Kim Dotcom. And the inquiry into the report's leakage links the GCSB issues directly to you.

In other words there is nexus between the Leaking of the Kitteridge report and what happened to you.

There would have been no Kitteridge Report to leak but for the illegal activity of the GCSB.

The GCSB Bill is now seeking to make what was illegal legal - and it is doing so on the basis of recommendations in the report that it was alleged that you leaked.

Moreover with no report to leak you would not have been tempted to leak one, and would therefore not have found yourself in this pretty pickle.

So much has been said on the matter which I think confuses things that I think it is worth recapping the background to how this all came about. Please tell me if there is anything in what follows that you disagree with.

The report that you were alleged to have leaked (and over which you were sacked as a minister) was not a secret report.

When you received the advance copy of the report you knew it was to be released in full shortly. In the final analysis its premature revelation was nothing more than cosmetic to the Government. It was embarrassing for the Prime Minister, but he could have just shrugged his shoulders and concerned himself with matters of importance.

However there were reasons that the Prime Minister was particularly interested in this report and this may explain why he took so much interest in finding out who leaked it.

This was a report which was sparked by illegal activity which took place under the watch of the Prime Minister himself, inside a secret department which he supervises and in fact according to his job title directly supervises.

Rebecca Kitteridge's report was very important both to national security and also to our legal understanding of how coercive power is used by the state.

It revealed that an arm of the Government had been acting illegally - breaching the fundamental rights to be free from unlawful search and surveillance of at least 88 NZers, without legal authority - for a period of nearly a decade.

It was therefore highly newsworthy and hardly surprising that a reporter of the quality of Andrea Vance would try quite hard to get a hold of it.

2. The illegal GCSB surveillance of Kim Dotcom was - like the privacy breaches against you - blamed officially on "fall guys" while the person ultimately responsible for both instances of investigatory over-reach - the Prime Minister John Key - claims to have known nothing about both incidents.

We know thanks to the release of court papers in the GCSB lawsuit that on December 14th 2011 there was a cross-departmental meeting held, attended by among others Crown Law, the Police and the GCSB (represented by Hugh Wolfenson, a.k.a. "Agent X" and another senior officer) to discuss the plan to - at the behest of the FBI - raid, arrest and extradite Kim and as many of his "co-conspirators" as the police could catch at a party for Kim's birthday in January 2012.

The paper records released to date also indicate that Hugh Wolfenson "Agent X" was acting director of the GCSB during the disclosed period of illegal surveillance of him and his friends.

At the time of the December 2011 meeting John Key's friend Alastair Fletcher's younger brother Ian Fletcher had been appointed to the role of Director of the GCSB. But he had not begun work.

Wolfenson is a career intelligence officer with huge experience. He even drafted the 2003 Act which he is now alleged to have breached.

As you know the "Minister in Charge of the GCSB" our Prime Minister John Key claims he had no knowledge of this meeting or indeed of the existence of Kim Dotcom until after the raid on Mega Mansion the following year.

And as you also know "Agent X" Hugh Wolfenson has now resigned from the GCSB and taken the blame.

The official explanation for why illegal spying was conducted on Kim Dotcom was that it was "The Police" who provided incorrect information to the GCSB and that they were the source of the mistake.

However any reading of the documentation which has been released makes this suggestion farcical.

The police officers were being led by the hand by senior GCSB officers, in fact by the most senior officer in the organisation at the time. The Police officers involved were clearly unfamiliar with the engagement with the GCSB and their emails on their face a breathtakingly naive - as indeed was the conduct of everybody involved in the "Billy Big Steps" arrest operation.

To compound this the officer in charge of the Police Operation, Grant Wormald - who hosted the December 14th meeting - went on holiday for most of the period of the surveillance operation.

The bottom line in all of this is that we have not yet established the truth of what really happened in operation Debut.

The Kitteridge report could not disclose the full details of this partly because to do so would probably open the crown to civil liability to Kim Dotcom and his colleagues.

In other words the background to the Kitteridge report is a huge mess which is yet to be cleaned up.

And what we also know is that this huge mess is the Prime Minister's responsibility - even though he claims to have been wholly unaware of all relevant facts throughout the entire affair.

Nevertheless the events occurred under his watch.

Which brings us to the related issue of the inquiry into the leak of the Kitteridge Report - which bears remarkable similarities to the Kim Dotcom debacle.

THE DAVID HENRY INQUIRY

The inquiry into the leak of the Kitteridge Report was set up by the Prime Minister and conducted under his authority.

The terms of reference were not that unusual albeit they were fairly specific. What was unusual about it however was the apparent ferocity with which these terms of reference were pursued.

With the benefit of hindsight it almost appears to have been vengeful in nature.

Hopefully we will find out more at the Privileges Committee - but I will not be holding my breath.

If this strange and peculiar case continues to run to its course to date then the Committee will be short sharp and perfunctory. If so then this will be a new low point in the history of Parliamentary Sovereignty in my opinion.

But let's look at what we already know about this inquiry - which is rather a lot.

Without permission your email records were searched and trawled for references to Andrea Vance. Details of this - showing how many emails were sent between you and Andrea - were provided to the Henry Inquiry without your knowledge.

In answer to a question about the authorisation for this from myself directed to Prime Minister John Key on August 5th the PM replied that yourself and John Banks ought to have been aware that this would happen from reading the publicly advised terms of reference of the inquiry.

This seems like a remarkably casual approach to your rights - especially given that the capacity you received the report under was as a support party minister serving on the Intelligence & Security Select Committee.

On the basis of the meta-data obtained - probably illegally and definitely in breach of the privileges of the house - you were identified by the Henry inquiry as the probable leaker and then pressured to provide access to your emails.

As I understand it that included direct representations from the Prime Minister via his chief of staff "when he speaks I speak" Wayne Eagleson.

In addition the inquiry sought your phone records and the access logs of yourself and Andrea Vance in the building.

Though the PM denies it (on the basis of a somewhat torturous reading of the correspondence ) the inquiry also sought the phone logs of Andrea Vance - one of my colleagues and a member of the Press Gallery. And it received them.

All of this to ascertain how a report - which was due to be published a week later - had found its way prematurely into the public domain.

And then the cover-up started.

The Speaker of the Parliament was apparently lied to by his own staff about the phone records of Andrea Vance. At the very least they were less than fulsome with the truth and eventually only found out via the persistence of Green Party Co-Leader Russel Norman.

And when it was revealed that Andrea Vance's phone records had indeed been supplied to the inquiry The Prime Minster then claimed that a contractor to the Parliamentary Service had made an error and that they had been deleted..

The Prime Minister even produced a 2 line email which he asserted cleared himself, his inquiry and his chief of staff of all responsibility for this serious attack on the freedom of speech. The General Manager of the Parliamentary Service - someone who nobody could possibly accuse of being anyone's lapdog - then resigned to take responsibility for the error.

A few days later, late on Friday, a more complete record of 135 further emails was released now showing that the phone records had in fact been sent to the inquiry twice, once by the contractor, and once by a senior Parliamentary Service staff member.

And these also showed that your emails had indeed been supplied to the inquiry in full.

This time Andrew Kibblewhite, Chief Executive of the DPMC, chose to take responsibility for the fact that the PM had not been informed of this detail.

And again the reason used to justify the screw-up was that it was due to lower level staff exceeding their authority.

You and us are expected to believe that the inquiry immediately deleted all the private information it was sent - which it ought not to have been sent - and that it did so in a manner that did not affect in anyway the conduct of the David Henry inquiry.

But even if we take the senior public servants responsible for all of this at their word - it doesn't explain why so many people in the orbit of an inquiry ordered by the Prime Minister had such odd lapses of judgment and thought it a good idea to attempt to cover-up their actions.

In your resignation press conference you referred to the extraordinary and unusual events that led up to your resignation. But you did not detail or explain what these were.

I look forward to your testimony to the Privileges Committee about those events. I hope you are given sufficient time to shed a great deal more light on what really happened in that inquiry.

What we do know is that like the Kim Dotcom Debacle this second instance of investigative over-reach is very squarely the Prime Minister's responsibility.

Like with the Kim Dotcom operation the events occurred under his watch and were implemented by people who report directly to him.

In both cases Prime Minister John Key claims to have not known anything about what was going on and in both cases very senior public servants have decided to take the blame, although in this case Andrew Kibblewhite has kept his job, so far.

Conclusion



So Peter, I sincerely hope you will find the above arguments compelling.

The illegal surveillance of Kim Dotcom (and the consequent GCSB Bill ), and the inquiry into the leak of the Kitteridge report are definitely connected.

They both involve illegal and enormously damaging use of surveillance technology.

They both involve the use and misuse of meta-data based intelligence - a matter which is poorly dealt with in the GCSB Bill as it is currently drafted.

They both involve the responsibility of officials working directly to the Prime Minister and matters which are very squarely the Prime Minister's responsibility.

And in both cases the Prime Minister's defence - like that of disgraced US President Richard Nixon - is that he did not know what was being done by people acting under his authority.

Peter, the fact is that the only person who can ensure the right thing is now done is you.



New Zealand stands this week at a crossroads.

New Zealanders proudly consider themselves to live in a mature democracy, governed by ethical and honest public servants and subject to the rule of law.

And New Zealand tops the Transparency International rankings because the rest of the world does so also. From this we gain considerable international influence and investment. We - as a nation - punch above our weight because we are generally considered to be nation with a high level of integrity.

If the GCSB bill is passed with undue haste this week in the absence of clarity around two cases of massive investigative over-reach by agents of the executive - as is the Government's intention - then I do not think New Zealand will be able to still claim that this is the case.

In a tweet exchange at the weekend I said you have an opportunity to be a hero.

You responded thus:

@althecat @robhosking that's rubbish Alastair, and I think you know it — Peter Dunne (@PeterDunneMP) August 16, 2013

Again, while I can understand your skepticism I think you are mistaken.

The people of New Zealand and Wellington and perhaps even Ohariu will be enormously grateful if you ensure that due process is properly followed and that at the very least the Privileges Committee inquiry into the report leak is completed before the passage of the GCSB Bill.

The issues at the heart of the illegal mass-surveillance controversy - which now thanks to the disclosures of former NSA staffer Edward Snowden are now several orders of magnitude more serious that they were when the Kim Dotcom case began - are globally significant.

What happens with the GCSB Bill this week in NZ matters not just here, but throughout the world.

In 1985 the NZ Government chose - backed by a massive public mandate - to pass legislation the effect of which was to stop US ship visits to New Zealand. Four years later the wall came down and thirty years later the number of warheads has fallen from 60,000 to 16,000.

The legislation New Zealand passed was trenchantly opposed by the State Department at the time.

The US was fearful of what message us passing such legislation would send to the rest of the world, and particularly Denmark, Norway and Japan.

28 years later with NZ nearly back in ANZUS there is a strange symmetry between those events and the current situation.

Now the US Government is keen for us to pass the GCSB Bill as quickly as possible.

This time the US would like an example of NZ's acquiescence to the legality of it's ubiquitous surveillance infrastructure to provide to other nations whose politicians are coming under increasing pressure to explain just what the NSA, GCHQ, ASIO (Australia) and GCSB are doing and why it is ok that they are doing what they are doing.

Here in NZ what happened to you at the hands of the David Henry inquiry illustrated the dangers of investigators who do not understand the limits of their powers.

What happened to you also illustrated very clearly why it is not ok to grant powers of surveillance to agents of the executive - especially when those powers are poorly defined.

I hope you agree with me that down this is path we find Star Chambers, despotism and the destruction of freedom.

This is not something that should be allowed to pass softly as if we do not care, while we concentrate our attention on what our Prime Minister thinks ought to concern us, namely, how much snapper we are allowed to catch.

Dear Peter, right now the only thing that stands between the aspirations of millions of NZers to live in a country they are proud of, and the passage of this bill is you.

And this is why I entreat you to think on what I am saying.

S.O.S. (Save our Souls) and do not support the third reading of the GCSB or TICS Bills until there has been a proper inquiry into the matters which are raised by the Kim Dotcom and David Henry cases of investigative over-reach.

Yours Sincerely

UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) — The world cannot afford such countries as the United States and Russia being at odds, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in an interview with RIA Novosti.

"I think it’s clear that the relations are difficult… [and] face many problems. But I am a strong believer that peace, security in the world are still very strongly dependent on the possibility of these two countries that are absolutely essential pillars of our international community – these two countries – to engage in a meaningful dialogue and to reach consensus in a number of areas that are of primary interest for both of us," Guterres said.

"The world cannot afford that countries as large, as powerful and as important as the United States and the Russian Federation are [being] at odds with each other," he said.

The relations between Moscow and Washington have even further deteriorated since President Donald Trump, who initially wanted to "get along with Russia," assumed office. The US imposed new sanctions on Russia, targeting its energy projects among other restrictions. Moreover, Russian diplomatic property has been seized by the US since late December. Recently US law enforcers conducted searches inside the buildings, prompting Moscow's strong condemnation.

Despite tensions with the United States over several issues, Russian officials have repeatedly voiced readiness to conduct an equal and mutually beneficial dialogue on global problems.

During the first meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Germany, an agreement on the ceasefire in southern Syria was reached, which has contributed to the peaceful settlement of the conflict.                                                                                     0279186-2718908e45f7aa63669da4d89cb36f50.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012667 00000000000 015024  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        With just one day, literally away from one of the most portentous presidential elections since 1964, the similarities eerie, African-Americans must be willing to take a leap of faith and shift from the Democratic Party to the Green Party and vote for presidential candidate Jill Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka. We have been in this abusive relationship far too long, that has taken our votes for granted, has not benefitted us and continues to posture itself as our one and only savior from the scary alternative—the right wing Republican Party. Yet, after all of these years, policy-wise, it has failed miserably.

In 1964 when President Lyndon Johnson was facing Republican Barry Goldwater, an open racist and repugnant, much like Trump, Malcolm forewarned Blacks, who like many in the Black community today, to not be fooled by the fear mongering. He stated “The shrewd capitalists, the shrewd imperialists, knew that the only way people would run towards the fox [Johnson] would be if you showed them the wolf [Goldwater].” Do we not find ourselves facing this very same dillema today? Before I go any further, because I can already imagine the looks on your faces and what you must be thinking. Is she advocating that Black people vote for Donald Trump? Absolutely, emphatically NOT!

North Dallas Gazette

By Nicole Scott, NDG Contributor

November 8, 2016

Donald Trump is indeed, the racist fascist, petulant, demagogue we suspect him of being. I have no doubt, should he win the election, he would do absolutely nothing to improve the status of the Black collective—but those are the operative words—Black collective. With the exception of a few chosen Blacks who have been given this Faustian bargain—that their individual success comes in exchange for towing the line, for maintaining the status quo and refusing to rock the boat, the masses of Blacks in America are already living in a Trump-like America.

In the city of Dallas Blacks represent slightly over 35% of those living below the poverty line. That means over 100,000 African-Americans are earning less than $11.00/hour when the living wage for just one adult is $10.24/hour. And yet the minimum wage in the state of Texas is $7.25. Texas is not an anomaly. It is merely a microcosm of the entire nation. A nation where according to Janet Yellen, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, wealth inequality is the highest it has ever been in the last 100 years.

I point this out because the Black collective, post integration, has a very distorted consciousness. Our lived reality versus how we perceive things to be do not align. We often live beyond our means, purchasing things that we not only can not afford, but do not need. We see ourselves as middle class based on our job, home or even automobile we may drive as opposed to our assets. Blacks have more student loan debt than Whites and Hispanics. Whites have 12 times the wealth of Blacks. Almost 50% of Blacks have no emergency savings. Hence, the masses of us are just getting by and one paycheck away from abject poverty.

During segregation, we knew we were disenfranchised, we recognized we were financially deprived. With the passing of integaration laws, the illusion of inclusion, we have been lulled into a slumber. We look at Oprah, Lebron, Beyonce and the Obamas on our large flat screen televisions and live vicariously through them. We somehow have deluded ourselves into believing that because these “exceptions” have made it, that means Black people are progressing, that things aren’t as bad as they actually are. Never mind the cold hard fact that we ourselves may be currently struggling or even if we’re not someone close to us is.

With all of the hardship, turmoil, oppression, lack of resources right in our midst we continue to put this false hope in a party that has failed us over the last six decades. But don’t take my word. Research the policies that Democrats have pushed that have crippled the Black community. The “war on drugs”, welfare reform, all specifically targeted Blacks and were orchestrated by Democrats. The gutting of funding for HBCU’s done by our Democratic Black president.

It is past time for Blacks to reasses our relationship with the Democratic Party. It is time for us to stop allowing the Democratic Party to frighten us into this blind allegiance to them because the big bad Republicans want to re-enslave us. The truth is the Democrats only offer a gentler, obtuse form of slavery.

Whether it is the President, the Governor or any elected official, no one person is going to save us. But there are policies that can greatly improve our day to day lives. It is time that we evolve in our polictical maturity and begin to leverage our votes to benefit us as a collective. Every ethinic group practices group politics except for us. It is not enough for me or a handful of us to be winning. We all gotta win.

I implore each of you to go to http://www.jill2016.com/platform and juxtapose it against Senator Hillary Clinton’s. Research Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka and ask yourself who do you think will speak for you. Forget what you might have “heard.” Research for yourself. And to those who might agree with the Green Party platform but feel they have no chance of winning, remember this is about building a movement. We have to be willing to sacrifice and struggle not for tomorrow, next year or even the next five years. We have to be willing to fight for the future of our children’s children. Vote your conscious. Vote Green 2016.                                                                         0279199-284e7703a17782ffc9df09614db967b7.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000021512 00000000000 015021  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        

Freshman electromagnetism questions

As I haven't quite managed to mention here before, I have occasionally been sitting in on one of Penn's first-year physics classes, about electricity and magnetism. I took pretty much the same class myself during my freshman year of college, so all the material is quite familiar to me. But, as I keep saying here, I do not understand physics very well, and I don't know much about it. And every time I go to a freshman physics lecture I come out feeling like I understand it less than I went in. I've started writing down my questions in class, even though I don't really have anyone to ask them to. (I don't want to take up the professor's time, since she presumably has her hands full taking care of the paying customers.) When I ask people I know who claim to understand physics, they usually can't give me plausible answers. Maybe I should mutter something here under my breath about how mathematicians and mathematics students are expected to have a better grasp on fundamental matters. The last time this came up for me I was trying to understand the phenomenon of dissolving. Specifically, why does it usually happen that substances usually dissolve faster and more thoroughly in warmer solutions than in cooler solutions? I asked a whole bunch of people about this, up to and including a full professor of physical chemistry, and never got a decent answer. The most common answer, in fact, was incredibly crappy: "the warm solution has higher entropy". This is a virtus dormitiva if ever there was one. There's a scene in a play by Molière in which a candidate for a medical degree is asked by the examiners why opium puts people to sleep. His answer, which is applauded by the examiners, is that it puts people to sleep because it has a virtus dormitiva. That is, a sleep-producing power. Saying that warm solutions dissolve things better than cold ones because they have more entropy is not much better than saying that it is because they have a virtus dormitiva. The entropy is not a real thing; it is a reification of the power that warmer substances have to (among other things) dissolve solutes more effectively than cooler ones. Whether you ascribe a higher entropy to the warm solution, or a virtus dissolva to it, comes to the same thing, and explains nothing. I was somewhat disgusted that I kept getting this non-answer. (See my explanation of why we put salt on sidewalks when it snows to see what sort of answer I would have preferred. Probably there is some equally useless answer one could have given to that question in terms of entropy.) (I have similar concerns about the notion of energy itself, which is central to physics, and yet seems to me to be another example of a false reification. There are dozens of apparently unrelated physical phenomena, which we throw into the same bin and call "energy". There are positions in gravitational and electric fields, linear motion, mass, rotation, heat, amplitude of waves, and so on, and all of these things seem to be interconvertible, more or less, and certain quantities of each can be converted into certain quantities of the others. But is there really any such thing as just plain energy, apart from its imagined association with these real phenomena? I think perhaps not. So energy is a very useful convenience in calculation, and I have no objection to it on that ground, but that does not mean that it is a real thing. Getting rid of it might lead to a clearer understanding of the phenomena it was intended to describe. (Perhaps my position will seem less crackpottish if I a make an analogy with the concept of "center of gravity". In mechanics, many physical properties can be most easily understood in terms of the center of gravity of some object. For example, the gravitational effect of small objects far apart from one another can be conveniently approximated by supposing that all the mass of each object is concentrated at its center of gravity. A force on an object can be conveniently treated mathematically as a component acting toward the center of gravity, which tends to change the object's linear velocity, and a component acting perpendicular to that, which tends to change its angular velocity. But nobody ever makes the mistake of supposing that the center of gravity has any objective reality in the physical universe. Everyone understands that it is merely a mathematical fiction. I am considering the possibility that energy should be understood to be a mathematical fiction in the same sort of way. From the little I know about physics and physicists, it seems to me that physicists do not think of energy in this way. But I am really not sure.) Anyway, none of this philosophizing is what I was hoping to discuss in this article. Today I wrote up some of the questions I jotted down in freshman physics class. What are the physical interpretations of μ 0 and ε 0 , the magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of vacuum? Can these be directly measured? How? Consider a simple circuit with a battery, a switch, and a capacitor. When the switch is closed, the battery will suck electrons out of one plate of the capacitor and pump them into the other plate, so the capacitor will charge up. When we open the switch, the current will stop flowing, and the capacitor will stop charging up. But why? Suppose the switch is between the capacitor and the positive terminal of the battery. Then the negative terminal is still connected to the capacitor even when the switch is open. Why doesn't the negative terminal of the battery continue to pump electrons into the capacitor, continuing to charge it up, although perhaps less than it would be if the switch were closed? Any beam of light has a time-varying electric field, perpendicular to the direction that the light is travelling. If I shine a light on an electron, why doesn't the electron vibrate up and down in the varying electric field? Or does it? [ Addendum 20080629: I figured out the answer to this one. ] Suppose I take a beam of polarized light whose electric field is in the x direction. I split it in two, delay one of the beams by exactly half a wavelength, and merge it with the other beam. The electric fields are exactly out of phase and exactly cancel out. What happens? Where did the light go? What about conservation of energy? Suppose I have two beams of light whose wavelengths are close but not exactly the same, say λ and (λ+dλ). I superimpose these. The electric fields will interfere, and sometimes will be in phase and sometimes out of phase. There will be regions where the electric field varies rapidly from the maximum to almost zero, of length on the order of dλ. If I look at the beam of light only over one of these brief intervals, it should look just like very high frequency light of wavelength dλ. But it doesn't. Or does it? An electron in a varying magnetic field experiences an electromotive force. In particular, an electron near a wire that carries a varying current will move around as the current in the wire varies. Now suppose we have one electron A in space near a wire. We will put a very small current into the wire for a moment; this causes electron A to move a little bit. Let's suppose that the current in the wire is as small as it can be. In fact, let's imagine that the wire is carrying precisely one electron, which we'll call B. We can calculate the amount of current we can attribute to the wire just from B. (Current in amperes is just coulombs per second, and the charge on electron B is some number of coulombs.) Then we can calculate the force on A as a result of this minimal current, and the motion of A that results. But we could also do the calculation another way ,by forgetting about the wire, and just saying that electron B is travelling through space, and exerts an electrostatic force on A, according to Coulomb's law. We could calculate the motion of A that results from this electrostatic force. We ought to get the same answer both ways. But do we? Suppose we have a beam of light that is travelling along the x axis, and the electric field is perpendicular to the x axis, say in the y direction. We learned in freshman physics how to calculate the vector quantity that represents the intensity of the electric field at every point on the x axis; that is, at every point of the form (x, 0, 0). But what is the electric field at (x, 1, 0)? How does the electric field vary throughout space? Presumably a beam of light of wavelength λ has a minimum diameter on the order of λ, but how how does the electric field vary as you move away from the core? Can you take two such minimum-diameter beams and overlap them partially? I did ask #6 to the physics instructor, who is a full professor with a specialization in high energy theory; she did not know the answer. [ Addendum 20090204: I eventually remembered that Noether's theorem has something to say about the necessity of the energy concept. ]

The average net household wealth in counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford and South Tipperary is €259,000, some €20,000 greater than the next wealthiest region, the mid-west (counties Clare and Limerick).

On the other end of the scale, the households with the least net wealth on average are in the west of the country (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon) where the figure comes to €186,000.

The border region (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo) is the only other combined area to have an average of less than €200,000.

Net wealth is a calculation of values of all real and financial assets (houses and savings respectively for example) minus all debt (mortgages and other loans).

While the average of the Dublin region is firmly in mid-table in relation to the rest of the country, the vast majority of wealth in Ireland is still concentrated in and around the capital with 28.3% of the total share.

This makes a degree of sense given the skewed population ratio in favour of Dublin but the figure still qualifies as almost twice the share of wealth of the next wealthiest region, the South-West (Cork and Kerry).



The lowest concentration of wealth in the country is in midlands counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath. Just 7% of Ireland’s debt-free money is concentrated there.

On the other side of the coin, the most indebted area of the country as a ratio to income is the mid-east region, or counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. The total for this area of 171% debt-to-income which suggests large loans that are unlikely to be serviced in full.

The best score from a debt point of view is in counties Cork and Kerry who rank just 65% debt as a proportion of income.

The state average for debt to income is 100.4% which firmly ranks us as a country used to living on credit.

Negative equity seems to be less of a problem than might be expected. The ratio of loan to value for principal residence mortgages stood at 73%.

Meath, Kildare and Wicklow again ranked worst from the point of view of mortgage loans to value, with a score of 91%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279132-b9945caca02e23b2dd7c5ccec6ea4c87.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004345 00000000000 015474  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Royal Bank of Scotland is closing over 150 bank branches and cutting hundreds of jobs, in response to changing consumer behaviour and a surge in the popularity of online and mobile banking, the Independent reports.

In a statement, the bank said that 30 RBS and 128 NatWest branches, which are also owned by the group, would shut. A spokesperson said that 470 jobs would be affected.

“We have seen a dramatic shift in the way our customers are choosing to bank, with more using mobile and online over traditional branch counter,” the company said.

“Simple transactions undertaken in branch at NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 43 per cent since 2010, while online and mobile transactions have increased by more than 400 per cent,” it added

RBS is the latest lender to respond to the changing way in which customers bank.

In January, HSBC said that it plans to close 62 branches this year, resulting in up to 180 job losses.

RBS said that despite the closures, it remained committed to providing services to its customers and had created a number of so-called ‘community banker’ positions.

Those in the new role will serve rural communities, “providing customers with personal assistance and support accessing the right banking options for their needs, as well as help with achieving their financial plans and goals.”

By the end of the year, RBS intends to have hired 50 community bankers.

“As customers change the way they bank with us, we must change the way we serve them,” a spokesman said.

RBS is still 72 per cent owned by the Government and has endured a turbulent period since the financial crisis. Last month it posted a £6.96bn loss for 2016, marking its ninth consecutive year of losses.

It was hit by £6.7bn in conduct and legal costs, including a £3.1bn provision for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities in the US, and also spent £2bn on restructuring its operations.

RBS has now lost more than £50bn since it received a £45bn bailout from taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis.

When it reported results in February, it already said that it would cut £750m of annual operating costs this year by eliminating jobs and closing branches and predicted it would return to profitability in 2018.

Despite promises by the government to clamp down on so-called ‘facility time’, there remain 371 local authority staff members who spend more than half their time working for trade unions, while being paid by the taxpayer. The cost of facility time (paid time-off taken by trade union representatives to carry out union duties) was at least £14,648,030 since 2012. Nearly a third of those local authorities analysed did not publish the data on their involvement with unions, thereby breaking the law.

The map of local authority Pilgrims waste extends across Britain: The worst offenders nationally are Birmingham City Council with £1,124,924 and Leeds City Council with £502,095;

In the North East, Sunderland – £258,697;

In the North West, Bolton – £390,481;

In Scotland, City of Edinburgh – £244,576;

In the East Midlands, Leicester City Council – £494,544;

In the South West, Bristol City Council – £134,931;

In London, Lambeth Borough Council – £281,000;

In the South East, Brighton and Hove City Council – £262,016. Alex Wild, Research Director of the TPA, said: “Trade unions are voluntary bodies of members and so should only receive the support of those members, not taxpayers. A huge amount continues to fund union duties, often without the express knowledge or consent of taxpayers, which simply isn’t right.” David Cameron’s government began the process of dealing with Pilgrims, time for Theresa May to see it through…                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0279167-7b7a9609e0d7673bdb4749cd7f356c22.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003264 00000000000 015071  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Trump lashing out at Amazon on Twitter could have serious consequences 2:10 PM ET Fri, 30 June 2017 | 01:00

President Trump is shooting himself in the foot with ill-advised Twitter attacks like the one he did this week on Amazon.

The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, reported earlier this week that a number of Trump's golf properties were displaying a fake issue of Time magazine with Trump on the cover. Trump proceeded to attack Amazon and the Washington Post in a tweet accusing the "fake news" paper for protecting Amazon for not collecting sales taxes from online purchases:

This attack was ill-advised for a number of reasons.

For one thing, the underlying accusation is unfounded. If Trump were more up on the real news he would have known that Amazon started collecting sales taxes nationwide as of April 1, and even before April 1, Amazon collected sales taxes in most states.

Trump diminishes his credibility a little more each time he launches an unfounded accusation. He would do well to the words of Albert Einstein: "Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters."

He would also do well to consider George Will's observation, in a "Meet the Press" appearance in March, that Trump's lack of credibility, undermining of the intelligence community, and constant labeling of various reputable news organizations as "fake news," will become a serious problem when the country has to take bold action in the face of a threat from North Korea or elsewhere and the threats and the president need to be believed.

The president is setting himself up to be "the boy who [tweeted] wolf," and that will be a problem when wolves appear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0279159-5650574fbb19b19bfe86a79fe18acdc9.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011170 00000000000 015307  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Google has rejected the French data protection authority’s demand that it censor search results worldwide in order to comply with the European Court of Justice’s so-called right to be forgotten ruling.

The company’s rejection of the ruling could see its French subsidiary facing daily fines, although no explicit sanction has yet been declared.

The ruling, made in May 2014, requires the search engine to remove links to pages that “appear to be inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive … in the light of the time that had elapsed”. Even accurate data that has been lawfully published initially can, the court said, “in the course of time become incompatible with the directive”.

Google grudgingly acquiesced to the ruling, which was based on a case brought by a Spanish man who wanted to remove an auction notice of his repossessed home dating from 1998, and started to take requests from the public for links to be removed from European domains soon after.

As of March 2015, the company had received nearly 220,000 requests to remove links to online information, including many high-profile requests from criminals, politicians and public figures, and slightly less than half of the request have been granted. But figures obtained by the Guardian show that more than 95% of the requests come from everyday members of the public.

In September 2014, a Parisian court went a step further than the original ruling and ordered Google to remove links from its entire global network if they violate the right to be forgotten. In November 2014, it threatened the company with daily €1,000 fines if it didn’t comply.

Then, in June 2015, the French national data protection authority, CNIL, stepped in and made the same demand, ordering Google to apply delisting on all versions of its search engine. The authority’s rationale is that removing links just from the French, or even European, versions of Google’s websites does not sufficiently protect the right to be forgotten, since readers can still go to Google.com, the company’s American site, and find unexpurgated results. This works even within European countries.

CNIL said that “in accordance with the CJEU (European court of justice) judgement, the CNIL considers that in order to be effective, delisting must be carried out on all extensions of the search engine and that the service provided by Google search constitutes a single processing”.

The company was given 15 days to comply, but Google has today said it will not be doing so. A spokesperson said: “We’ve worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten ruling thoughtfully and comprehensively in Europe, and we’ll continue to do so. But as a matter of principle, we respectfully disagree with the idea that a national data protection authority can assert global authority to control the content that people can access around the world.”

In a blogpost, Peter Fleischer, Google’s Global Privacy Counsel, said: “We believe this order is disproportionate and unnecessary, given that the overwhelming majority of French internet users – currently around 97% – access a European version of Google’s search engine like google.fr, rather than Google.com or any other version of Google.”

Additionally, Fleischer added, the company is concerned that complying with the French courts could potentially set a precedent that one country’s laws can control access to content globally. “There are innumerable examples around the world where content that is declared illegal under the laws of one country, would be deemed legal in others: Thailand criminalises some speech that is critical of its King, Turkey criminalises some speech that is critical of Ataturk, and Russia outlaws some speech that is deemed to be ‘gay propaganda’.

“If the CNIL’s proposed approach were to be embraced as the standard for internet regulation, we would find ourselves in a race to the bottom. In the end, the internet would only be as free as the world’s least free place.”

Google’s difficulties are just the latest example of a major web firm struggling to deal with the practicalities of offering the same service across a number of different nations. Facebook has been sparring with European data protection authorities for several years over whether it is sufficient to comply by the rules of Ireland, where its European subsidiary is based, or if it has to abide by every individual European nation’s regulations.

Most recently, Facebook was ordered by a German regulator to relax its real-name policy. Directly addressing the issue of jurisdiction, the German regulator told the firm “if you like our game, you must play by our rules”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0279071-ed4b542c413bff684702853fc4802deb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007621 00000000000 015122  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Thiago Silva guarantees he is a new man.The current ACB light heavyweight champion and father of two daughters feels set free from the "drama of big teams", and the Brazilian seems to have regained inner peace after the whirlwind that cost him his UFC contract in 2014. And for that Silva credits believes family is responsible for the change.Happily married again and the father of two little girls, Silva recently sold his academy in Florida and now focuses only on his own training. With the ACB belt's defense set for July 23, the fighter ensured that the first step to reaching the top in MMA is to live a quiet personal life without great controversy."I have two girls, one is one year old and the other is two", Silva said. "My wife is Brazilian, but she was born there and came to the US. Everything changed, you start to value life. But I want to stay at home and take care of my family. The head changes, you start to have different values."Alternating between Florida and California for his training, as well as fitting in sessions in Chechnya, Silva follows a program that few are putting into practice in MMA. Not fond of bigger teams, Silva prefers to prepare himself with his own coaches to ensure total focus on himself, even if that means the absence of training partners of the highest level."I have a good friendship with Rafael [Cordeiro], he was my first coach," Silva said. "When I have a fight, I stay there with him [at Kings MMA in California] and [former UFC heavyweight champion Fabrício] Werdum, but now I sort of do my training alone. When I'm in Florida, I have my personal coaches and I do my training. When I have a fight scheduled, I go to King's and train with Rafael, or I go to Chechnya to train there."For a while, it didn't seem to be a safe bet that Silva would see such bright days in his career again.When the light heavyweight powerhouse seemed to have rediscovered the focus on his MMA career and was gaining momentum through two victories in the UFC after two suspensions for failed drug tests, the bottom fell out of Silva's world. The 34-year-old was accused of having invaded a gym while threatening people in a situation that played out in live time on public forums.The affair turned out to be a conflict with his then-wife, who proceeded to post private videos of Silva that she claimed proved that he was using drugs. The incidents cost him his contract with the biggest MMA organization in the world."I made my mistakes, I think I married the wrong woman the first time, she did not help me at all, she took me into the hole and just wanted to know how to spend my money", Silva insisted. "I had other slips with other women. I'm in better shape, in a better phase [now], I don't dwell on the past. I was arrested for something I did not do."The case was closed for lack of evidence. Everyone is innocent until proven otherwise, and nothing has been proven against me -- my record is clean."With that, Silva hopes to keep his career comeback alive. After having trained at various gyms, from American Top Team to Brazil's Macaco Gold Team to the infamous Chute Boxe gym, Silva's training situation is still a bit wild. It was because of developments at the notable Blackzilians camp that left Silva training mostly on his own now."Every team that has a good start goes by money", Silva said. "[But] it's the fighter who puts his health at risk and suffers injury. [At the Blackzilians], friction started to emerge between the owner and the coaches. The owner invested a lot of money in the team [and] started to f**k with people for money. He started to promise and not fulfill, to increase the earnings. We were fed up with money and lies and the staff ended up leaving."Still, times aren't too bad in one of the wilder of many Silva households in the sport of MMA."I don't make the same money I earned in the UFC, but I still do well," Silva said. "I have a good life, I have a beautiful family, and I can take care of them well."                                                                                                               0279193-d4b33e9376d543ecb9a5a474e92c3bca.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004016 00000000000 015265  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A Women’s March initiative released a toolkit targeted to high schoolers and college students to teach them to resist, the group announced Thursday.

The toolkit comes through the Women’s March EMPOWER, an initiative from the Women’s March Youth. The kit is meant to serve as a guide for young activists who want to change their communities, the group said.

“Today, our Women’s March Youth arm is excited to launch a toolkit for young activists to create high school and college chapters that guide students in making a positive impact in their communities,” the group said in a tweet.

The organization has partnered up with other organizations like Rock the Vote, PeaceFirst, Rise to Run and Teen Vogue to get the program started.

The new program highlights three key areas for young potential activists: empowering themselves through “effective” organizing, empowering themselves through voting and empowering themselves for running for office.

“Effective organizing begins with a deep understanding of the change you are trying to create and relies on clear articulation of both where you are and where you want to be. The toolkit provides a comprehensive dive into each stage: Choose, Understand, Plan, Act, and Reflect,” the organization noted.

The initiative also plans to support young women who may want to run for office by partnering them up with Rise to Run to train them and mentor them as progressive candidates.

“The training covers the fundamentals of building a campaign, what it looks like to run as a progressive, the structure of holding local office, and other ways to show up in your community as a candidate, and eventually as an elected official,” Women’s March EMPOWER said.

"We will set up country's first coral garden at Mithapur coast which will conserve coral species. Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and Tata Chemicals Limited (TCL) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to set up the first of its kind coral garden," Senior Advisor to WTI, BC Choudhury said.

The project will be funded by the Gujarat forest department as WTI has signed a broader MoU with the state also, said Choudhury.



Choudhury, who conceptualised this project in the 2006, said that WTI got success in the initial experiments for conservation of the coral species at the proposed site which they think is fit to develop as coral garden.

As per the project plan of the Mithapur Coral Garden, the reef will be separated into various sections where almost all the coral species will be made available at one place.

"The 'Mithapur Coral Garden' will be one of its kind and it will house nearly all coral species found in Gulf of Kutch. Just as in a terrestrial botanical park or garden, the reef will be separated into various sections, based on accessibility," a report brought out by WTI and TCS which contains the proposed plan of the Mithapur Coral Garden said.

"The tidal pools are primarily targeted for the coral garden. Each pool will contain a variety of corals, and will give a special emphasis to the placement of different species. It would be useful not only for education and tourism, but also restoration of the reef," it said.

Tourists will be able to watch the beauty of corals as the authorities plan to have wading, snorkelling, diving, representative pool, jetty and boat anchoring areas in it, the report said.

WTI Field officer of the Coral Reef Recovery Project S Subburaman said, "This is an opportunity to create the first coral garden in the country, which will have major role in the conservation by serving as the mother reef for new sites".

"This project run by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) is in partnership with Gujarat Forest department and Tata Chemical Ltd. Tata is our funding agency," Subburaman said.

"Controlled and regulated tourism and diving can be allowed near coral gardens, ultimately helping in conservation awareness for common people," the report said.

Waking Times

[Editor’s Note: This is the third part of a series on this subject from David Gardner, who contributes to ConsciousReporter.com. Read part I here, and part II here.]

The depiction of dark forces is almost omnipresent in today’s most well-known music industry acts. Why are these ominous messages promoted? Where does this dark influence come from? This article examines the hierarchy of evil influence in the music industry, delving into sources of darkness usually hidden from view.

“We have reached a period in the history of the world when ignorance is criminal and deserves the heaviest penalty. Ignorance is not black magic, but it is the greatest ally that the black magician has in the world today”. – Manly P. Hall

In the first two parts of this series we looked at the way positive esoteric symbols have been distorted and used as symbols of evil, bringing darkness into the homes and lives of millions by their persistent use in popular culture. We also looked at the agenda in the music industry to promote the dark side, and the way darkness is glorified and indulged. But what is behind all these depictions of evil? Is there a conscious dark intelligence guiding the direction of the music industry? Or are artists just cashing in on the latest in-fashion craze?

Let’s take a trip down the music industry’s dark occult rabbit hole.



Music is about communicating ideas and emotion

Music undoubtedly has a huge impact upon us. Music can help us be happier, it can inspire and uplift us, but the wrong kind of music can make us angry, aggressive or depressed. We may feel drawn to listening to particular types of music and then resonate with the lyrics and the visuals which accompany it, often with a song playing in our heads throughout the day. But how often do we stop to think about where the ideas we are consuming come from?

There is nothing accidental about the music industry, even in its perceived rebellion against accepted ideas. Everything is scripted, choreographed and carefully constructed to have a particular impact, pervading the culture we are immersed in every day.

“Artists, creations and ideas that do not fit the mainstream way of thinking are mercilessly rejected and forgotten by the conglomerates, which in turn makes them virtually disappear from society itself. However, ideas that are deemed to be valid and desirable to be accepted by society are skillfully marketed to the masses in order to make them become self-evident norm”. – Vigilant Citizen Source

To this end, researchers have discovered that we don’t always like music for the reasons that we think. The more we are exposed to a song – even unconsciously – the more the pleasure centres in our brain respond to it, even if it is not a good fit for our usual musical tastes. So while it may seem that certain songs are played over and over on the radio because they’re popular, it’s often the case that they’re popular simply because we are exposed to them so often.

Record companies can therefore easily control which artists become successful, and by association what values become ingrained in our subconscious and popular culture through saturation and repeated exposure.

In many instances the depictions of darkness we consume are displayed in a subliminal manner through costumes, staging, and video clips. Studies have shown that subliminal messaging does work, and that we are able to perceive the emotional value of subliminal messages particularly when those messages are negative. But in a lot of cases this symbolism is right in our faces, with nothing subliminal about it. How much more powerful then is this influence?

This subliminal and overt indoctrination appears to be part of a global experiment in darkness, where we are being programmed to accept and even appreciate dark values through mass exposure.

But where is this message coming from? Is it coming from the artists themselves, the directors of their videos, or the producers of shows like the Grammys, the Super Bowl half time show and the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs)? Is it coming from the owners of companies or from their affiliations with secretive and occult groups? Could it even be coming from the forces of darkness themselves beyond this world?

This goes deeper than religion

“Truth is stranger than fiction because fiction is obliged to stick to the possibilities; truth is not.” – Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain)

While religious values are often portrayed in a negative light in the work of popular artists, I personally don’t believe this is about religion as much as it is a wider campaign throughout society – also encompassing fashion, entertainment, the media and politics, where spiritual and esoteric values are being eroded and replaced with values of darkness.

Esoteric societies have existed throughout time, long before the advent of Christianity which many believe is the target of the negative symbolism in popular culture today. Despite many Christians seeing everything esoteric as evil and Satanic, this is not the case. Esotericism has a benevolent history with ancient civilisations such as the early Egyptians and other sun worshipping cultures basing much of their culture and architecture around sacred esoteric principles.

Unfortunately, as cultures degenerate and spiritual schools are infiltrated by darkness, positive esoteric symbols become mixed with negative ones. As a result many of the remnant secret societies we are left with today such as the Freemasons and Rosicrucians, while appearing to have a basis in positive esotericism, now also contain practices and teachings of darkness and materialism, which affects the perception of esoteric spirituality as a whole.

“Throughout history the knowledge has been split into three kinds: white (light), black (darkness) and grey (a mixture). White knowledge has been continuously infiltrated and attacked by dark forces and its reputation muddied and lost, thus many sacred deities and spiritual principles became seen as black, while dark forces such as Baal were seen as spiritual. Dark forces and ceremonies have existed alongside white esoteric knowledge, obscuring and confusing their meanings to the public. Secret societies of dark knowledge exist to this day, having passed through centuries largely undetected, yet accumulating power. They use the symbols of knowledge of light but invert them. Grey esotericism is practiced by those who don’t know what they are doing. Many modern day secret societies, some established in the public arena, societies with clear financial and other non-spiritual agendas and popular Satanism, are examples of this. Today dark esoteric knowledge has come to thrive to the virtual exclusion of white knowledge. It’s easier to achieve results in dark knowledge – it brings power, wealth, fame, and pleasure. Whereas white knowledge is difficult to attain – it requires suffering and sacrifice, often poverty and brings wisdom, peace, love and liberation, qualities that most readily drop in favor of pleasure, power and darkness”. ― Belsebuub Source

This may be part of the agenda of darkness to confuse and alter the message of positive esotericism to such a degree that it is almost impossible for anyone searching for the light to find it.

For many artists and those in the music industry’s hierarchy of influence above them, this appears to go well beyond the realms of religion to personal experience of forces beyond this physical world. Unfortunately they appear to be in touch with the dark side rather than the light.

“Some understanding of the intricate theory and practice of ceremonial magic may be derived from a brief consideration of its underlying premises. First. The visible universe has an invisible counterpart, the higher planes of which are peopled by good and beautiful spirits; the lower planes, dark and foreboding, are the habitation of evil spirits and demons under the leadership of the Fallen Angel and his ten Princes. Second. By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is possible to contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in some human undertaking. Good spirits willingly lend their assistance to any worthy enterprise, but the evil spirits serve only those who live to pervert and destroy”. – Manly P. Hall, The Secret Teachings of all Ages

Satanism

“There is a beast in man that should be exercised, not exorcised.” ― Anton Szandor LaVey

There are many connections that can be seen between the music industry and groups such as the Church of Satan who focus on the indulgence of the animalistic aspects of human nature, but also incorporate many negative or inverted spiritual symbols in their work and rituals.

Here’s what Nikolas Schreck – husband of former Satanic high priestess Zeena Schreck (LaVey) and son-in-law of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey – had to say in the 1980s about how musical frequencies could be considered a useful vehicle to promote dark values due to their popularity with the youth. This video is about 2 minutes of a longer interview in which he also talked about a coming new world order:

30 years later it seems that some music is being used in the way outlined by Schreck. Take the 2001 MTV VMA performance by Britney Spears of “I’m a Slave 4 U” where she dances carrying a huge python, imagery reminiscent of Satanic rituals, both real and imagined. The tempting serpent is synonymous with evil which caused humanity to fall and lose its innocence.

Satanic influence is also clearly visible in actor / director / musician James Franco’s clip for Love in the Old Days (NSFW) by his band Daddy. The clip represents, in Franco’s own words, the “marriage of hell” and re-enacts a real Satanic ritual called Das Tierdrama. This ritual is said to have been based on the book the Island of Dr Moreau by HG Wells where half-human half-animal hybrids are created in strange scientific experiments, leading the protagonist to understand when he goes back to society how close to becoming animals humans really are.

The video clip for Love in the Old Days was inspired by and featured Kenneth Anger as the main “priest”. Anger was a lifelong friend of Anton LaVey and a disciple of a Aleister Crowley. He directed the movie Lucifer Rising in which Lucifer is summoned in order to bring about a new occult age. Anger said of the movie: “I’m a pagan and the film is a real invocation of Lucifer … The film contained real black magicians, a real ceremony, real altars, real human blood, and a real magic circle” Source.

Although Franco has stated that he was mainly interested in the aesthetic of the ritual, his interest in the occult appears to go beyond that. In his own words he sees Kenneth Anger as the “priest of darkness”, and partook with Anger in a re-enactment of the “Bartzabel Working” ritual used by Aleister Crowley to invoke the spirit of Mars, where Franco acted as the “base material” – the vessel that the spirit would manifest through. Source

Even at the beginning of rock music there was a Satanic influence, with the Rolling Stones naming their 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request. Lead singer of the Stones Mick Jagger also composed the score of a later film by Kenneth Anger that starred Anton LaVey called “Invocation of My Demon Brother”. Interestingly the Queen has held an audience with Mick Jagger, and he has even been granted a knighthood!

Of course, the many theories online about Satanic influence in popular music have been mocked by high-profile stars such as Conan O’Brien, who opened the 2014 MTV Movie Awards by stating “Welcome to the satanic cult awards ladies and gentleman. All hail the dark lord” (cheers and laughter from the audience). He has also joked on his show about the controversy surrounding Madonna’s Super Bowl halftime show in 2012 which many believe contained Satanic symbolism. This is somewhat ironic as O’Brien has been a featured speaker at the Bohemian Grove which performs rituals that harken back to the days of worshipping demonic gods with child sacrifice.

Aleister Crowley, the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) and the Golden Dawn

If you have ever looked into the occult you’ve probably come across Aleister Crowley, a man who has had a huge impact on Western occultism through the OTO and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Although he did not found these organisations he has played a pivotal role in the direction of their message, introducing black practices and teachings. If you haven’t heard of Crowley, you may be surprised just how much influence this man – who proclaimed himself “The Great Beast” and signed his name with three sixes – has had upon the music industry.

Crowley advocated the use of hard drugs in magical rituals in order to create the “breakage of consciousness” and was known to evoke demons to do his bidding. Using bodily fluids and faeces in his rituals he misused and abused ancient eastern tantric practices (which he had only limited first-hand knowledge of) as part of initiation rites. Through the propagation of his own perverse form of “sex magic”, Crowley is largely responsible for popular misrepresentations of Tantra, a complex and varied eastern tradition centred on seeking spiritual liberation, which in the West has largely been adulterated and divorced from any wider spiritual context and made almost solely about sex and seeking increased sexual pleasure.

Crowley styled himself as the Antichrist and was labelled by the press the “wickedest man alive”. He owned a mansion in Scotland named after the demon Baal (the Boleskine mansion), who was worshipped with child sacrifice by ancient cultures which had degenerated.

Crowley made multiple attempts at impregnating women – which he called his Scarlet Women – with a “moonchild”, evoking the w**** of Babylon into their womb to create a living Anti-Christ. His most well known text, central to his teachings, was the Book of the Law. He received guidance to write this book from a being he called Aiwass, his “guardian angel”. Aiwass reportedly gave Crowley some rather strange advice if it was truly coming from an “angel”:

“To worship me take wine and strange drugs … LUST, enjoy all things of sense and rapture. Fear not that any God shall deny thee for this.” Source

He is perhaps most well known however for his dictum “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law” and spoke about “the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will”. As opposed to white magicians who respect freewill, the Divine, and natural laws, black magicians use the power of their personal will in order to break natural laws, gain power and fulfil their desires without regard for people’s freewill, the divine will or for universal laws.

“A black magician is one who seeks to gain authority over spiritual powers by means of force rather than by merit … The black magician is firmly of the belief that he knows what he needs, when in reality he only knows what he wants. He seeks to mold the Plan into his own desires … Age after age, the wants of man destroy him. In ignorance he plays with fire; in thoughtlessness he ignores the immutable laws of nature, and then wonders why the tempests break about his head … He neither obeys the laws of force, nor recognizes that cause and effect rule all things; that day after day, he reaps misery as the harvest of thoughtlessness … Nowhere is black magic more apparent than in the modern phases of religion. In both the new and old doctrines, instead of emphasizing the will of the Logos [God] as the law of men, students have been taught to demand of the Infinite, and that He will obey”. – Manly P Hall, Magic: A Treatise on Esoteric Ethics

The OTO appears to be esteemed in celebrity circles and many music industry artists have been inspired by Crowley’s work.

In David Bowie’s song ‘Quicksand’ he says:

“I’m closer to the Golden Dawn

Immersed in Crowley’s uniform of imagery”.

In 1976 he stated:

“My overriding interest was in cabbala and Crowleyism. That whole dark and rather fearsome never–world of the wrong side of the brain.” Source

He also stunned the world when in a 1976 Rolling Stone interview he said:

“Rock has always been the devil’s music . . . I believe rock and roll is dangerous . . . I feel we’re only heralding something even darker than ourselves.” Source

Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin is said to have performed Crowley rituals on stage and had such a great interest in Crowley’s teachings that he bought Crowley’s Boleskin residence.

Jay-Z, Tyler the Creator from Odd Future, Adam Lambert, Taylor Momsen and Ciara have all been seen wearing clothing referencing Crowley, with Ciara blatantly displaying “XIV Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn” on her clothing in the video clip for Super Turnt Up. The XIV is a reference to a dark initiation which is part of the rites of the Golden Dawn.

Many stars including Lady Gaga have their own take on the phrase “Do what though wilt” and the Beatles went so far as to put Crowley on the album cover of their album Sgt Pepper’s lonely hearts club band amongst pictures of their heroes.

Crowley can also be credited with the phenomena of back masking, where artists include subliminal messages in their songs which can be discovered upon playing them in reverse. For Crowley this was known as the “Law of reversal”:

“. . .train himself to think BACKWARDS by external means, as set forth here following.

(a) Let him learn to write BACKWARDS. . .

(b) Let him learn to walk BACKWARDS. . .

(c) Let him. . . listen to phonograph records REVERSED

(d) Let him practise speaking BACKWARDS. . .

(e) Let him learn to read BACKWARDS. . .” – Crowley, Aleister. Magick: Liber ABA, book four, 1994 Ordo Templi Orientis edition, p. 639

In Satanic churches the law of reversal is reportedly used in black masses. Under an inverted cross they will “recite the Lords prayer but they will start with “Amen” and say “Nema” and then recite the whole prayer backwards.” Source

The use of reversal is a common trait of black magicians, as black magic is a perversion and inversion of white magic.

“The black magician…must…distort the histograms so that they typify the occult fact that he himself is distorting the principles for which the symbols stand. Black magic is not a fundamental art; it is the misuse of an art. Therefore it has no symbols of its own, It merely takes the emblematic figures of white magic, and by inverting and reversing them signifies that it is left-handed.” – Manly P Hall, Secret Teachings of All Ages

Backmasking in music was considered such an issue that legislation was proposed in 1983 in Arkansas and California that would require albums that included backmasking to be labelled as such.

The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that “can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the Antichrist” Source

The Arkansas law initially passed unanimously, but was later returned to the state senate by Governor Bill Clinton and defeated.

An example of back masking appears in Jay-Z’s track Lucifer, which contains the number of the beast, the words “I will introduce you to evil” and “Murder, murder Jesus” when played backwards:

Freaked out yet?

James Franco has even gone as far as saying that Crowley’s disciple Kenneth Anger, has inspired much of the use of occult symbolism in the music industry today due to his influence on the music videos of artists such as The Rolling Stones.

Next up we’ll look at the hierarchy of influence behind the dark values promoted in the music industry.

Seoul (AFP) - North Korea's military on Sunday threatened to blow up balloons that South Korean activists plan to send over the heavily-militarised border carrying 10,000 DVDs of the satirical Hollywood film "The Interview".

Activists plan to launch copies of the film -- a comedy about a fictional CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un -- as well as 500,000 propaganda leaflets across the border on or around March 26.

Pyongyang has long condemned such balloon launches and threatened retaliation, and local residents have complained the activists are putting their lives at risk by making them potential targets.

"All the firepower strike means of the frontline units of the (Korean People's Army) will launch without prior warning... to blow up balloons," the North's frontline military units said in a notice to the South.

It said the launch would constitute "the gravest politically-motivated provocation" against North Korea and "a de facto declaration of a war", according to Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency.

The move is aimed at "deliberately escalating tension on the Korean peninsula where the situation has reached the brink of a war due to... joint war rehearsals" by South Korea and the United States, it said.

The South's military said it would retaliate if the North opens fire on its territory.

But the North's notice warned that any challenge to its "just physical countermeasures" will trigger "merciless retaliatory strikes".

South Koreans living near the border are "recommended to evacuate in advance for their safety" if the balloons are launched, it said.

The launch will mark the five-year anniversary of the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010, with the loss of 46 sailors. The South pinned the blame on the North and effectively froze trade and investment ties.

The warning came even after South Korea's Unification Ministry on Friday vowed to take steps preventing the launch in order to protect local residents, saying there is a "limit" to freedom of expression.

Seoul insists the activists have a democratic right to carry out such launches, but has appealed for restraint to avoid overly provoking the North.

South Korean police have occasionally prevented the launches at times of high cross-border tensions, citing the possible dangers posed to local residents.

The activists remained tight-lipped about the exact location and time for the launch.

In October last year North Korean soldiers attempted to shoot down some balloons, triggering a brief exchange of heavy machine-gun fire across the border.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0279092-d2669327fab42539e4f126856fd7caa8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007247 00000000000 015071  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Share This Article:

The Chargers and city missed a deadline Friday to reach an agreement on a stadium plan that would lead to a public vote in January, a “bittersweet” moment for the team, according to special counsel Mark Fabiani.

This is considered to be the last day San Diego and the Chargers can forge an agreement in time to have the City Attorney’s Office draft a ballot measure and get it approved by the City Council in time to hold a special election.

At a lunch meeting of the Albondigas Political Society, Fabiani outlined a series of missed opportunities that could have led to a deal, including former Mayor Jerry Sanders rejecting a joint stadium-convention center project downtown.

Fabiana also cited current Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s appointment of a task force to study the stadium issue instead of immediately beginning negotiations, and moving ahead with an expedited environmental study of the proposed Mission Valley site.

“As a result, we stand here with our fate in the hands of the NFL owners,” Fabiani told members of the organization, which is named after a Mexican meatball soup.

He said the moment was bittersweet when paired with the hopes of a new season that begins Sunday with a home contest against the Detroit Lions.

The Chargers have been wanting a new stadium for nearly 15 years and have acquired land in Carson, an L.A. suburb, to build their own facility — possibly in concert with the Oakland Raiders — in case they cannot make a deal in San Diego.

St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke, meanwhile, is aiming to build a stadium in Inglewood, another Los Angeles County city. NFL owners will have to decide if all, some or none of the teams will be allowed to move into the potentially lucrative Los Angeles market, which has been without a franchise for more than 20 years.

“We can’t control that — we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Fabiani said.

Fabiani said such a decision could be made late this year or early next year, and that the Chargers would adhere to the ruling.

In a statement, Faulconer thanked fans and civic officials who helped San Diego make its best case to the NFL owners, and that city and county leaders remain ready to negotiate.

“While it’s no surprise that the Chargers have allowed today’s deadline to pass for a January 12 special election, San Diego can still hold a public vote on a new stadium during the normal election cycle in June or November — if Chargers ownership is willing to work in good faith with their hometown,” the mayor said.

In answering media questions after his talk, Fabiani refused to speculate on when or whether the Chargers might return to the negotiating table.

He said the city was “wedded” to a “legally insufficient” environmental study of the proposed Mission Valley site — next to Qualcomm Stadium — that cannot be the basis for further talks.

“The city would have to go back to square one and do (the EIR) the right way,” Fabiani said.

The Chargers ended stadium negotiations in June after objecting to the city’s expedited timeline, which produced an environmental impact report much faster than usual. Fabiani contends the report will not survive court challenges.

Faulconer, county Supervisor Ron Roberts and City Attorney Jan Goldsmith have said the quick EIR is valid because a project would simply replace existing Qualcomm Stadium, so the impacts are already known.

Two visions of the future of farming played out in Oxford this week.

The five-year-old Oxford Real Farming Conference (ORFC) at the town hall, sponsored by organic farming company Sheepdrove and dominated by small-scale farmers, food campaigners, and the agro-ecology movement, has now outgrown the establishment conference, the decades-old Oxford Farming Conference.

While the latter’s delegates – predominantly larger-scale landowners and the agrifood industry’s corporate representatives – were enjoying morning prayers in University College chapel, before a Barclays Bank breakfast, followed by a political session sponsored by agriculture equipment manufacturer Massey Ferguson with environment secretary, Liz Truss, and her labour shadow, Kerry McCarthy, and then dinner in Christ Church college, the alternative conference was debating proposals to radically reform the industrialised intensive model of agriculture they represent.

The current agroindustrial food system is “serving the world so badly it needs to wither on the vine,” said Colin Tudge, founder of the ORFC.

Calling for a complete rethink of the way we farm and cook, he said step by step reform of the status quo would not address the crisis in the global food system, which currently leaves a billion people worldwide chronically hungry, another billion suffering from food that is not fit for purpose but makes them ill, and endangers many species and wild habitats.

A new rural manifesto to tackle inequality in the countryside was launched at the alternative conference by the Land Workers’ Alliance and The Land magazine. The alliance said there was a crisis of housing in rural areas with many young people being driven out of their native villages by a lack of affordable accommodation and public transport. It outlined government action needed on rural housing, transport, energy, employment and land reform, to prevent the countryside becoming the “preserve of the affluent” who live but do not work there.

“Family farms are declining in numbers, commercial farms are becoming larger and increasingly corporate, entry into the industry is increasingly difficult and the average age of farmers is worryingly high,” said land campaigner, Simon Fairlie .

The manifesto calls for agricultural subsidies to be capped at €150,000 per individual farmer so that taxpayers’ money is redirected to smaller and active farmers and away from richer landowners. It also calls for the break up of oligopolies of processors and retailers to protect famers from aggressive pricing.

Farming as currently structured has become economically unsustainable, as well as socially and environmentally destructive, according to Tom Lines, expert in commodities pricing at University of London’s Goldsmiths college, told the conference.

Over the last four decades the cost of inputs had risen far more than the value of agricultural commodities, meaning the money farmers could make from food production was inadequate to keep people on the land in many countries including the UK, Lines warned.                                                                             0279052-d79f4f5b902301d9c019dd0d1bb213e0.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000015013 00000000000 015073  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Metal Multiculturalism

There’s always one or two at every metal gig I go to in London. Amid the sea of white faces there are always one or two black fans standing out from the crowd. The question I want to ask is “What are you doing here?” Not because I don’t think black people should be into metal, but because I want to know what drew them to heed metal’s call.

Reading Laina Dawes’ book What Are You Doing Here? A Black Woman’s Life and Liberation in Heavy Metal I found my curiosity about black metal fans both validated and rejected. Validated because the very fact of a black woman writing a book about her own and others experiences in the metal scene suggests that this is an ‘issue’, a question that needs to be answered. Rejected because asking ‘what are you doing here?’ reinforces black people’s otherness in metal.

At one level, Dawes demonstrates that the answer to the question is totally unsurprising. Black women (and by extension black men) like metal for the same reason anyone else does. For some human beings, metal simply strikes a nerve; it allows them to find meaning, to deal with intense emotions, to find pleasure in a complex world. Nothing in Dawes’ book suggests that black female metal fans are anything out of the ordinary save in their determination not to be put off.

But turn the question on its head and things get more complicated. Why do so few black people seem to like metal? As Dawes shows, there are practices of exclusion and self-exclusion that mean that only small numbers follow her path. Not only does direct racism play an important role, but the very surprise that greets the putative black metal fan can be intimidating even when it is well intentioned. Dawes’ interviews with black female metal musicians shows how black women can be treated as exotic novelties in the metal scene. While a few thrive on this, it takes guts to walk into a metal show as the only black woman – not everyone wants to stand out.

Then there is the powerful force of black musical cultures which, since at least the late sixties, have turned away from rock towards other musical forms. Black people themselves can and do look at black metal fans with curiosity and even scorn.

Dawes’ experiences and the experiences of other black women in metal she talks to in the book, show how much to be black is to be confronted with a burdensome set of expectations as to what one should like and how one should act. As someone who was adopted by a white family in the largely white Canadian town of Kingston, she knows what it is like to feel pressure to conform to a particular racial model. As Dawes explains, her love of metal is often explained away as the result of being ‘raised white’, making her not ‘really’ black.

What Are You Doing Here does metal a valuable service by highlighting the ways metal scenes are racialised. Dawes tries to raise the racial consciousness of the metal scene that she so clearly loves. She draws attention to the work of some interesting black female musicians and shows that black heavy metal did not begin or end with Living Colour.

Still, I can’t help thinking that Dawes could have gone further in her argument. The situation with regard to metal and blackness is both worse and better than she implies.

Why worse? Consider this:

In the last 2-3 decades, metal has become incredibly diverse globally. There are strong metal scenes throughout the world and even those long hold-outs, India and China, now have burgeoning metal cultures. Moreover, bands around the world have incorporated a wide range of ‘folk’ musics and local influences into their sound. Yet, with one exception (Botswana), black sub-Saharan Africa and the black Caribbean are almost entirely metal free. Even in cosmopolitan cities like London, where one can hear dozens of languages at metal gigs, black people are the most striking absence.

Metal emerged from the blues, yet since the 1970s any trace of black musical influence has been systematically removed to the point where Hendrix and Led Zeppelin have only a qualified place in the metal canon. It’s no coincidence that the most loathed metal sub-genre, nu metal, is also the one that has been most active in incorporating black (principally rap) musical influences. Metal today fuses with a vast range of musical styles – but it is black styles that attract controversy.

There is no doubt then that exclusion of blackness is a fundamental element of metal. The experiences that Dawes recounts are the tip of the iceberg.

Yet as I said, the situation is better than it might seem. Consider this:

Metal may be strongly coded as ‘not black’, but its coding as ‘white’ has become seriously eroded, (despite the efforts of metal’s openly racist fringe.) In fact there is good cause to go further and conclude that metal is now one of the most diverse and cosmopolitan global music scenes.

Metal does not ‘have to’ incorporate blackness to be politically and musically valid. Not everything has to include everything. Schlager does not need to incorporate the music and experience of Laotians, Soca does not need to incorporate the music and experience of Slovenians.

What metal does need to be is open to the involvement of those black people who wish to join. As Dawes shows, there are many barriers here, subtle and not so subtle. But Dawes’ experience as a writer not just of this book but also for a number of metal publications, also shows that the glass ceiling can be broken. Black men and women can and do get involved in metal scenes and be treated with respect and equality.

One of the reasons why this is possible – and why, as I say, the situation is better than it might seem – is because metal has a strong ethic of togetherness that binds that metal world together. Being a committed fan and metal scene member can overcome all kinds of barriers. True, the initial entry into metal may be harder for black women than almost anything else, but once through the door things get a lot better.

Hopefully Dawes’ book will help erode barriers to black women’s entry into metal even further. Perhaps we are near a tipping point when the last remaining citadel holding out against metal’s global dominion will fall. Perhaps having more black people in metal scenes and making music will reconfigure what ‘black music’ means. Perhaps the exclusion of what we currently think of as black music will give way to the inclusion of a form of black music we cannot now even envisage.

The Garland company has a pretty cool concept. You use your phone to find a bike. They cost a buck an hour to rent. You can park them anywhere.

As much as I’d like to support a local company, VBikes just got some competition, and I think the new kid in town has an advantage. This morning I spotted some orange bikes on the sidewalks of downtown. They belong to a San Francisco outfit called Spin. Same basic deal. Use your phone to find a bike. Scan to unlock. A buck for 30 minutes. The big difference: VBikes charges a refundable $99 when you sign up. Spin doesn’t.

You see where this is headed, right? Clearly the game here is market penetration, not revenue. I plan to enter this bike-share arms race with my new company, Petal to the Meddle. It’s a bike-share system for people who have trouble with homophones. And when you ride a PTTM bike, it pays you a buck an our. (Dad jokes!)

UPDATE: I rode a Spin to lunch and can report that I enjoyed the experience. There was a slight hiccup the first time I tried to use the app to unlock a bike, but after I closed the app and restarted, it worked fine. Apple Pay worked seamlessly. The seat was easy to adjust. The front-mounted basket proved useful in carrying my copy of the New York Times Magazine.

Riding on a Main Street sidewalk back to work, I got stopped by three twentysomethings. “Hey, how much is the deposit on that?” one of them asked. “It’s not like VBikes,” I said. “No deposit.” See what I’m saying about that advantage? Though I will say this: no one will use a bike that is broken. VBikes, it seems, are engineered to tolerate abuse, with those thick spokes and airless tires. Not so Spin.

I must also report that another bike-sharing outfit is coming to town. Look for Lime bikes to show up soon.

Instagram and YouTube will be the latest additions as the city police invests heavily in technology to reduce response time and to track first responders live.

Bengaluru's police, which has taken the tech policing concept to a new level with its vibrant social media intervention, is soon going to be active on Instagram and YouTube.

The city police boasts of nearly four million combined followers, who at least once a day go through what they put out—be it traffic alerts, action taken against criminals, posting initiatives, greetings, or rules to follow.

The police's presence on social media is robust, as it also actively engages netizens with replies, retweets, shares, and even takes up cases suo motu based on what people put out on social media posts.

The Bengaluru City Police FB page is followed by 5.2 lakh people and the Bengaluru Traffic Police page by 4.54 lakh and counting. Their Twitter handles are also hugely popular with @blrCityPolice having 6,03,000 followers and the traffic police @blrCitytraffic having 3,23,000 followers. The handles have been in action from August 2012 and September 2013, respectively, and have grown in popularity.

City Police Commissioner Praveen Sood declares: “For the police, reaching the public is a challenge. Through technology, we are able to communicate and reach more people in a metropolis where the population is 11 million.”

Sood says the police communicates with users through various modes. Some of the officers, too, have a huge following, like Sood himself, who is followed by 8,10,000 Twitter followers at his handle @cpblr and Deputy Commissioner of Police (traffic east) Abhishek Goyal who has 82,000 followers while his personal handle has 38,000 followers.

“We use social media extensively as Bengaluru is a young city and has a high number of people embracing technology. We are on Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, phone, and will shortly be on YouTube and Instagram.”

Tech policing

“We are adopting what is called the ‘tech policing’ concept. We have taken up social media to communicate with people. As for the police, reaching the people is the biggest challenge—in normal times as well as in emergencies. In normal times, the police would like people to avoid certain routes as a VVIP may be arriving and therefore help people time their movement on such roads better. Or during sudden riots when anti-social elements spread rumours, police use social media to reassure citizens,” says Sood.

Police personnel keep an eye on the live images fed onto large screens from hi-resolution CCTV cameras fixed across the city.

There are other ways for the public to interact with the Bengaluru police. There is a Dial 100 app and the recently introduced Suraksha safety app which has already been downloaded by 8,000 Bengalureans and counting.

To leverage social media, the city police has hired experts and outsourced social media activities. Regular followers have even complimented the cops on the quality of messages, their tone and tenor.

Videos, the way forward

Recently, they uploaded two videos—one on drunken driving and the other on towing as these two are major pain points for the public. “Both went viral and we received a huge number of likes and comments for them. The video on drunken driving contains a message not to be afraid if a policeman flags you down to check for drunken driving. It has the steps that the traffic police have to follow and what the legal or permissible limit of alcohol intake is,” explains Sood.

No need to visit a police station

The police want work done for the public without having to go to a police station. For example, the Bengaluru police e-lost app is one such where citizens can lodge complaints of small but dear losses. Around 1.20 lakh complaints have been registered on it so far—which means 1.20 lakh complainants did not have to go to a police station to lodge loss of phones, wallets, documents. The e-lost app will generate an FIR online which can be printed and is recognised as a valid document even to apply for duplicate education certificates.

The Bangalore Traffic Police social media sites are very popular with users and they also have a ‘public eye’ where members of the public can upload photographs or videos of traffic violators, on the basis of which the police take action.

Sood says technology helps in routine work without physical interaction. “We want to change the police culture and that of people’s attitude towards the men in uniform.”

Route to police station

The Bengaluru police is also launching an app called Know My Police Station. In a first for the country, it allows users to set their location and immediately know the jurisdictional crime or traffic police station. This app directs users to the police station from the given location by showing the route!

The city police too was the first to introduce PoS machines after demonetisation to collect traffic fines.

Outsourcing call centre

The Bengaluru City Police is also expanding and outsourcing its control room based on the Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh experiment where the police has outsourced to private agencies.

“The concept is simple. We are expanding the police control room phone number 100 to 100 lines. Currently, we have only 20 lines and there is a huge delay when it comes to response. With 100 lines from different telephone companies, people in distress can call from any telecom operator they have subscribed to and the call will be answered within 15 seconds. We will also call back in case there are missed calls.”

Earlier, policemen manned the control room number in shifts and there were complaints of huge delays and calls not being answered or not getting through.

Sood says,

These policemen will all be shifted out by the end of this month as they are trained for policing and not answering calls. This activity is being completely outsourced to a private company and police officers on duty at the control room will be the decision-makers as to what actionable process to take next.

In the same way, a police control room vehicle, named Hoysala in Bengaluru, will be despatched to the scene, if needed, within 15 minutes of receiving a distress call. These first-responder vehicles were earlier attached to respective police stations but now have no such jurisdictional problems and once the mobile cops arrive, they will deal with the issue themselves or escalate it further to senior policemen as the control room will be in the loop.

All these changes will be open to third-party audit as the Bengaluru police is becoming very quality conscious.

The police commissioner wants the people in distress to dial the number 100 only for any help and the person who answers the call will decide what further action has to be taken. As every Hoysala vehicle is tracked live, the call centre will be able to keep track of the entire process from call to closing the complaint.

Reducing response time

The police commissioner and his team is working hard on reducing the response time, and all this activity is being monitored live on their desktops.

Sood explains that an average call to the number 100 contains 3.55 minutes of conversation. “This is because we Indians are genetically loquacious and don’t come to the point immediately. Often they quote some senior officer or politician they know and then only tell the operator what the problem is, forgetting that this line does not need influence for action and is meant for those in distress! For this reason, it takes the person who attends the call 1.02 minutes to decide on what action to take next. And, if a Hoysala is then despatched, the day’s average response time per Hoysala stands at 17.10 minutes as of today. We want to bring it down to less than 15 minutes, but it is very tough,” he says.

Even as we speak, two policemen who took 32 minutes to respond to a law and order problem the previous night citing jurisdiction were being suspended.

A new command centre being set up at the Bengaluru City Police commissioner's office

Gesturing towards his desktop, Sood points to an image of a cluster of vehicles similar to the ones that show up on a smartphone when one books an Uber or Ola. “Right now, 70 Hoysalas are in mission mode and responding to complaints while the ones coded red are either having their designated rest or are parked somewhere waiting for the control room to call them.”

Reading out statistics, the officer says from the morning, the city police had closed 156 events where Hoysalas responded and even as he explained, he pointed to the desktop which showed that those manning the control room were putting four Hoysalas on standby. On an average, 61 percent of the complainants called in are due to fights of all kinds, 12 percent due to family problems and 11 percent seek redressal for private nuisances like neighbours playing loud music or loitering in front of the caller’s house.

Spending on tech

The Bengaluru police is spending Rs 20 crore on technology that will improve its response time and reach on social media. It has also received sanction to spend Rs 10 crore a year for the outsourced call centre.

The command centre also displays images on large screens from 150-odd CCTVs installed in trouble-prone areas of the city to keep an eye on crime and images from 170 traffic police cameras are also fed to the command centre. There are plans to increase the hi-definition pan, tilt, and zoom cameras to 560 soon, says Nagendra Kumar, DCP, control room.

All these steps are being taken to keep the city safe as well as improve technology that helps police reach people, Sood concludes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0279082-237a5dd4fee046b22e0069432e2261c4.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003720 00000000000 014742  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio -- Longtime Service Director Andrew Fornaro, who has served 53 years with the Mayfield Heights Service Department, said today's snowfall represents the heaviest he has seen this early in the year.

Fornaro said trees and tree limbs have fallen on houses, cars and across roads due to the wet, heavy nature of the snow.

"We had a tree fall on a house on Larchmont, on a car on Mayfield Ridge, and on a house on Ranchland," Fornaro said. "We've got more than 40 calls about downed trees and limbs. You wouldn't believe how many trees are down."

Snow started falling in the Hillcrest area at about 2:30 a.m. Snow plowing crews were put on the roads at about 4:30 a.m. in Mayfield Heights, Lyndhurst and other Hillcrest communities.

"We've got about six-eight inches and it's still falling," Fornaro said at about 10:15 a.m. "The wet snow is the worst because it's harder to push."

Fornaro said his crews have made it to every street in the city at least once and are now on their second round of the streets.

Lyndhurst Service Department Foreman Bill Milner said nine men were out plowing the streets this morning and that eight or nine men were specifically out dealing with fallen limbs.

"No, not really," Milner, a 34-year service department veteran said when asked if he had seen such a snowfall this early in the season. "We usually have some snow in October, the earliest was maybe Oct. 2 or 3, but nothing like this."

First Energy spokesman Mark Durbin said there are approximately 40,000 customers without power in Cuyahoga and Geauga counties. Durbin could not give an exact count, but he said, "About three-fourths of the customers without power in Cuyahoga County are in [the Hillcrest] area.

"We are asking people to be cautious around all fallen limbs because the are taking down power lines," he said.

Durbin said First Energy is hoping to restore power to many of its customers by late today, but added that some won't have their power back until Friday.

A couple of decades ago, my wife and I worked on a horse farm where everyone was explicitly instructed not to ever clean the cobwebs inside the barn. Sure, the owners themselves would occasionally, very carefully, almost surgically, remove a few targeted old cobwebs here and there, but the majority of the webs remained up at all times. Explanation? Spiders don't bother anyone, while flies and mosquitoes bother both horses and humans.

On the other hand, for balance, there is an old Serbian proverb that goes like this: "If there were no wind, spiderwebs would cover the sky"

I assume this is said every time someone complains about the strong eastern wind, Koshava, that sweeps through the country in autumn.

And this situation - spiderwebs covering the sky - is something that happens in Mark Twain's story Some Learned Fables, For Good Old Boys And Girls, featuring Herr Spider as one of its key characters. I read Twain's short stories over and over again as a kid. Still love them.

Why are we so enchanted by spiders, in real life, in mythology, and in popular culture? I certainly am, always was.

There were Little Miss Moffet, and Itsy Bitsy Spider.

As a little kid, I watched, and was greatly impressed by the old film Tarantula. Later I could not help myself - just had to watch Eight Legged Freaks and Arachnophobia. And yes, Spiderman, despite its scientific...er, bloopers.

Of course I knew about Arachne and the beautiful myth of the origins of the callipygous Shenora Spider (does such a species even exist in reality?).

And then there are spiders in literature. I was scared by the Spider-Man in John Wyndham's The Chrysalids. I fought the giant spiders of Mirkwood when I played The Hobbit computer game on Sinclair ZX Spectrum back in 1981 or so, after I have already read the book both in Serbian language and the original English. There was Shelob in Lord of the Rings, and Aragog in Harry Potter.

And of course, the best spider in all of history - Charlotte!

Today is the 60th anniversary of the first publication of Charlotte's Web, the beautiful, haunting story of a talking pig and a writing spider.

Interestingly, growing up in Yugoslavia the first 25 years of my life, I have not heard of Charlotte's Web until I came to the States. But then I had kids. And kids loved to watch the movie over and over again. So I read the book.

And to this day, occasionally, spontaneously, I start singing "Isn't it great that I articulate!" An important and heart-felt sentiment for a writer for whom words are toys.

Then I received in the mail (but am yet to read it, I promise I will), Michael Sims' book The Story of Charlotte's Web, a biography of E.B.White and the story of the making of the book.

But not everything is fiction and myth. I am a scientist at heart. Each one of those invented characters always made me want to learn more about the real creatures.

A couple of months ago, I went to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City (thanks for the tickets, you know who!) to see their new exhibit - Spiders Live. Yes, "Live" is a good description - there are plenty of living specimens in there, many quite fascinating.

As usually happens in museum exhibits, there was plenty to learn about what we know. Anatomy, physiology, ecology, evolution, geography, behavior. Sure, there were a couple of non-spiders there, like scorpions, but it was clearly explained exactly why they are not spiders and how they are related.

One could see a short video showing how Gladiator spider catches its prey by throwing a carefully counstructed web trap on it, like this:

And they mentioned the Bolas spider which catches its prey by lassoing it in with its bolas-like ball of silk:

Interesting - to me at least, as a chronobiologist - is that the Bolas spider uses its circadian clock for an interesting function - it produces different blends of chemicals in its pheromone at different times of night (pdf) to coincide with different times when two different species of moths are flying around, each species attracted to a specific mix of aromatic chemicals.

But beyond learning facts, I was also looking at the ways the exhibit tries to include the scientific process - how we know what we know about spiders? I was looking for, perhaps, descriptions of ingenious experiments on the courtship signaling in wolf spiders, or the research on unique social, colonial spiders. Nope.

There was a part, at the end, which described how scientists collect spiders in the field, how they catch them, preserve them and label them.

And then I saw what I was really looking for. Yes! They did it! The exhibit had a really nice description of my favorite spider research ever! And there it was, The Charlotte's Web connection, and my own personal connection! I talked about it at the last #TriSciTweetup at the NC Museum of Natural Science in Raleigh NC, for the inaugural Lightning Talks with Brian Malow on Thursdays at the Daily Planet Cafe:

Back in 1948., zoologist H. M. Peters was studying how spiders spin webs. He was getting tired as he had to do all of his research late at night, when spiders spin their webs. So, he asked his friend Peter Witt, a pharmacologist, if there is anything that he could give to spiders that would make them spin during the day. Peter suggested amphetamines. It did not work. Spiders kept weaving at night. But, oh my, their webs looked crazy! They were like impressionist art!

Peter Witt was an amazing person, a wonderful man. I had the fortune to meet him once, in 1998, just a couple of weeks before he died. He was the Head of the institute for brain and behavior at Dorothea Dix hospital in Raleigh, now unfortunately closed.

Intrigued by the results his friend Peters got when giving spiders amphetamines, he turned his own research into that direction, using spider webs as windows into the way different chemicals affected the nervous system. Some of those were pharmaceuticals of the day. Others were drugs found relatively easily on street corners back in the 1950s and 1960s. Both were of interest to science, of course, for different reasons.

Different drugs had different effects on the shapes of the web. In high doses, almost every drug resulted in highly irregular webs. But at carefully chosen lower doses, there were some interesting differences. For example, under the influence of caffeine, the webs were vertically shorter but horizontally wider, as spiders made larger angles between the radial spokes of the web.

The most striking was the effect of LSD-25. Yes, LSD. This is the only drug which resulted in webs being more carefully weaved and more perfect than the controls.

Charlotte? Is that you?

Many years later, I was teaching a lab at NCSU in animal physiology. Part of the lab was a project, done by students under my supervision. Some students did projects on humans - each other. But the other half used animals. Invertebrates, as there was no time to get an IACUC (institutional animal care and use committee) approval for use of vertebrates (that is a long and difficult process).

One of my students decided to use Peter Witt's experimental protocol, applying a chemical that he never used way back then - serotonin. Result? Spiders made decent webs, but they took about twice as much time to make them. They went slow about it. They made perhaps half of the twists of the spiral before deciding that was the end, leaving about twice as much space between the loops of the spiral.

Spider brains are large and complicated. They are so large they can't even fill just the head, a part of them fills the thorax. Of course, spider brains are difficult to study. Not to mention that we do not have a spider genome sequenced yet so we do not have the tools to monitor what is happening in a spider brain. Thus, this line of research has been largely abandoned.

But it was not all in vain. Apart from being able to categorize substances along the lines of their effects on spider webs (often corresponding to their effects on human brains), this method now has a place in agriculture. Placing a few spiders in a field or orchard overnight and taking a look at the webs in the morning can tell the researcher if there are pesticides there, and perhaps which class of pesticide if not the exact kind.

Perhaps there is something in the air that can induce a spider to write "Terrific" and I'd love to know how it does that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0279081-cc8847e908efa052c6a8373d5563940c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004556 00000000000 015007  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Palestinians reject direct Iran aid to 'intifada' families

The Palestinian Authority on Sunday said Iran's direct financial assistance to the families of Palestinians killed in a five-month wave of violence would be unacceptable.

Tehran announced last week assistance would be offered to families of Palestinians killed in the wave of violence that erupted in October, but the PA says such aid must follow official channels.

Palestinian presidency spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina, cited by local media, said bypassing the authority in handing out such funds would constitute illegal interference in internal Palestinian affairs.

Iran should "send this money through official channels to the (PA's) Martyrs and Prisoners Foundation rather than relying on informal and circuitous routes," Abu Rudeina said.

Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mohammad Fathali, said Wednesday that Tehran would offer $7,000 to the families of each Palestinian killed in what he called the "Jerusalem intifada".

Iran will also give $30,000 to Palestinian families whose homes have been destroyed by Israel because a member is accused of carrying out an anti-Israeli attack, he told a news conference in Beirut.

The money pledged is in addition to the monthly aid paid since 1987 by an Iranian institution to families of Palestinians killed, he said.

The wave of violence in Israel and the Palestinian territories since October has killed 177 Palestinians as well as 28 Israelis, an American, a Sudanese and an Eritrean, according to an AFP toll.

Most of the Palestinians who died in the violence were killed by Israeli forces while carrying out knife, gun and car-ramming attacks, according to Israeli authorities.

Others were shot dead by Israeli forces during clashes and demonstrations.

Iran has been accused of providing support to Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip and is a rival to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party. Fatah dominates the Palestinian Authority.

Palestinian economists have questioned whether Iran would be capable of distributing the aid to the families directly via banks since it could be considered "terrorism financing".                                                                                                                                                  0279035-46c5ef6c31b07155b53855ff391bc39c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002610 00000000000 015042  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Hayley last year described P.A.M.E.L.A. as "shiny, utopian horror" and going by the new trailer, that remains a solid assessment. But you don't have to take her word for it — the game is now in Early Access, giving you the opportunity to get killed in terrifying ways all on your own.

Due out in March this year, P.A.M.E.L.A. developer NVYVE Studios decided to take the Early Access route to iron out bugs and gameplay issues:

We're getting close to a point where the core mechanics — exploring, looting, fighting, building, and upgrading — are fleshed out and ready to be experienced in an early state. We've got a lot more planned in terms of content updates, including a rich non-linear narrative element, that is coming down the pipeline in the following months in Early Access.

Reviews are cruising at 77 per cent, which bodes well, considering it's still being worked on, though I'd be concerned if it drops below 70 before release.

In terms of setting, P.A.M.E.L.A. takes a page from the worlds of Dead Space and BioShock, with the player waking up in a "fallen utopian city ravaged by a horrific disease". Fortunately, you have an assortment of gadgets and weapons to keep you alive.

The game is currently at a discount — $US24.99, or $33 in local dollars — with the full release upping the price. If you're keen, you can grab it right now on Steam.

CEO Stephanie Burns regularly secured space for these female entrepreneurs by organizing networking events and mixers for women. That all came to an end for Burns when two men, Allen Candelore and Rich Allison, tried to enter one of the female-focused events.

In a video posted to YouTube, Burns said, “These men came uninvited and the venue was over capacity,” so she turned them away. The next thing she knew, she was hit with a lawsuit from the two men, claiming they were being discriminated against based on their gender. They were represented by Alfred G. Rava, who is notorious for carrying out lawsuits against organizations who have any kind of event geared towards women. In fact, he was involved in a class-action lawsuit against the Oakland Athletics Baseball organization for gender discrimination over their Mother’s Day promotional event wherein they gave free breast cancer awareness hats to women.

How much did that lawsuit end up costing them? $510,000.

It’s not clear how much the out-of-court settlement cost Chic CEO, but they chose that over an expensive legal battle.

But how does Rava win these (clearly ridiculous) cases? He cites the Unruh Civil Rights Act, a California anti-discrimination law from 1959. He seems to target events that are geared towards women, or events in which women are apparently preferred over men. Rava—as well as National Coalition for Men president Harry Crouch, and the two plaintiffs in the Chic CEO case Candelore and Allison—have been leaning on the Unruh Act in lawsuits for quite some time now.

Frankly, the lawsuits are ridiculous. But more than that (so much more than that), there’s a special kind of insult in taking an anti-discrimination law and twisting it to “protect” those least in need of protection.

The threat of a lawsuit is usually enough to shut a company down, even if the company stands a good chance of winning in court, simply for one reason: it costs less to settle than it does to fight in court. With the knowledge of a likely easy settlement, plus precedent on their side, how messed up is it that this is a weapon that can be used to stamp out organized attempts at improving representation before it even begins?

According to Yahoo! News, Rava “doesn’t see the value in women-focused events, even if they have no discriminatory intent. He calls the desire to hold them ‘strange and sad.'” Rava denies that this is true and also denies the veracity of an email Yahoo! News claims to have received from him in the same article.

The beach on Timber Wharf at Westminster Pier Park is between three and four metres above the water.

"To get down to the water level would have been cost-prohibitive for us," says Dean Gibson, New Westminster's director of parks, culture and recreation.

"And secondly, that section of the river has a very, very fast running current. In the interests of public safety, it was better for us to retain the existing condition which kept that physical separation between the water and the general public."

Still popular with families

Even though they cannot dip their toes in the water, and the fine sand is only about 30 centimetres deep, several locals have already embraced the beach as a popular spot to relax with their families.

"I think it'll be a nice place for families to come and just relax, get away from the humdrum of the city," says Jill Parpatt.

Melissa Fiorucci has taken to the beach wholeheartedly, staking a spot with a blanket, and soaking up the sun in a bikini.

"I wouldn't probably want to swim in this water anyway," she says, "It's nice to just be out, lay down, get comfortable, and have good views, and you get the wonderful breeze off the water. So you can't complain, really."

"We like it a lot," says fellow beachgoer Marco Alucema, "Because the volleyball courts get really busy around five or six in the evening. We come here about that time.

"Now this urban [beach] is more for the kids, so they get to play here, play football, play in the sand and all that. So it's really good."

"My daughter is just two, and we live here in New Westminster, and we've discovered this beautiful park. We've been down here every day," Melanie Flint says.

"With her only being two, going to the actual beach is a really long destination, so for us to walk here, it's perfect."

Comparisons with Paris?

There are other examples of beaches like this, says Gibson.

"In Paris, they have the Paris Plage. Every summer, they convert a section of their waterfront highway into this long linear beach area, and it's been wildly successful for a number of years."                                                                                                                                                      0279207-54aa18ef0c8d6eab0b6ef63adff8441a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003672 00000000000 015500  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Pin 27 Shares

Java EE 8 adds some nice capabilities to the platform:

Servlet 4.0 API with HTTP/2 support

Enhanced JSON support including a new JSON binding API

A new REST Reactive Client API

Asynchronous CDI Events

A new portable Security API

Server-Sent Events support (Client & Server-side)

Support for Java SE 8 capabilities (e.g. Date & Time API, Streams API, annotations enhancements)

...

Today, you can use these new features using GlassFish 5.0 and hopefully with additional Java EE 8 application servers in the near future. Below you will find some resources that might help you to get started with Java EE 8.

One of the challenges we faced in this release is that we moved from the old Java.net infrastructure to GitHub in the middle of the development cycle. It wasn’t necessarily simple but we now clearly see the benefits of such a modern collaborative software development platform! Exploring the code is now just one link away! We hope the GitHub adoption will make the platform more accessible to developers.

Java EE 8 is really the result of a teamwork involving many people:

All the JCP Specification Leads and all the Expert Groups members

All the people involved in developing the different Reference Implementations that comprise Java EE

The different Java EE implementers

The Java EE community at large

And many others who most of the time works behind the scene like the team at Oracle who develops GlassFish itself and the team managing the build infrastructure!

Kudos to all of you! Java EE 8 wouldn’t have been possible without your work and dedication!

As you probably know, this is just the beginning as we are working, together with the community including the Eclipse Foundation, Red Hat and IBM to open Java EE even more by transferring its development under the auspices of the Eclipse Foundation (see here and here). There are many discussions going on and we hope to be able to share additional details at JavaOne.

Today also marks the general availability of Java SE 9. As mentioned above GlassFish 5.0 leverages new features in Java SE 8, and is certified today on Java SE 8. Even though we have a lot of work in front of us with the transition to the Eclipse Foundation, our current intent is to certify Java SE 9 in an upcoming GlassFish 5 release. We will keep you posted on future developments in this area.

It has loads of practical tips (don’t make it too long, use a nonserif font for titles, etc.) and jokes about the mating habits of cute red pandas. The guide has been remarkably popular—he estimates it’s been viewed about two million times over the years—and he gets e-mails thanking him all the time. It has become a claim to minor fame.

Sometimes people, um, borrow his guide without giving him credit. This happens fairly regularly, and when he finds out about it, he sends an e-mail asking them to take it down. Usually they do. But when he sent an e-mail to the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research, asking that a roughly 1,200-word, near-verbatim, uncredited chunk from his guide be removed from the consortium’s materials, the response was unexpected.

Rather than apologies, a lawyer sent him a cease-and-desist letter accusing him of plagiarizing the consortium’s materials and demanding that he take down his guide or face a lawsuit seeking damages up to $150,000.

Purrington was taken aback. Understandably.

The consortium also took exception to Purrington’s e-mail. In that message, Purrington requests that the plagiarist’s head be mailed to him “if you can cover shipping charges.” The consortium’s lawyer wrote that this was interpreted as a “physical threat against their personal safety” and said the group would call the authorities if there were any further threats. While the consortium apparently liked some of Purrington’s clever lines in the guide enough to repeat them, this particular witticism did not strike the group as humorous.

So what is the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research? Glad you asked. It’s a nonprofit that, according to its Web site, has received more than $60-million in federal grants from the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency over the last 20 years, plus some $80-million from unspecified industry sources. Big money. The consortium then doles out that money in grants to universities like Iowa State to study plant resistance to aphids and such.

In the not-at-all-friendly letter sent to Purrington, the consortium’s lawyer explained that the material was created by the consortium itself in 2005. That would be a very strong and persuasive point if Purrington hadn’t posted his guide as early as 2001, a fact that can be verified by going to the date-stamped Internet archive. Back in the aughts, Purrington was a professor of biology at Swarthmore College; these days, after quitting his tenured position (!) to spend more time with his kids, he is a self-described house husband and works part time as a photographer and graphic designer. He likes the lifestyle change, though he misses the lab sometimes.

He started writing the guide back in 1997 as part of a class he was teaching, made it available to his students, and later posted it for anybody who wanted to use it. Even though it appears obvious who actually wrote the guide, Purrington still has to pay a lawyer to respond to the consortium’s lawyer. He estimates his legal bill so far at around three grand and growing. Along with being costly, the whole experience has been a huge bummer.

“I felt violated, and then I was accused of something I didn’t do. I’ve never had the feeling of both of those at once,” he says. “The plagiarism certainly made me mad, really mad, but what made my blood boil was that they tried to bully me with a lawyer.”

I called the main number for the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology Research and was told that the president and chairman, Dorin Schumaker, was not available and might not be available for weeks. Schumaker is the only paid employee listed on the nonprofit’s most recent available Form 990 tax filing (her salary, according to the filing, is $213,964). I then called a number listed for a Dorin Schumaker in St. Simons Island, Ga., where the consortium is based. The person who picked up the phone declined to answer questions and hung up when asked if she was Dorin Schumaker. The consortium’s lawyer, David Metzger, also hung up on me. In a follow-up e-mail, he said he was abiding by his client’s wishes.

If they can explain how they created, in 2005, a document that Purrington posted online years before, they’re keeping that explanation mum for now.

Too often in plagiarism cases, the victim never really gets satisfaction. Maybe the offending passage is taken down. Perhaps a footnote is added. The plagiarist might even manage a mumbled apology. But the penalties are often piddling. This is the first case I’ve heard of in which the apparent victim may be the one who gets punished.

In a characteristically witty blog post, Purrington asks for an apology from the consortium, reimbursement of his legal fees, and “an all-expense paid trip to St. Simons Island, Georgia, for me and my family, to compensate us for the pain and suffering that their bullying has caused.”

My guess is that those round-trip tickets won’t be forthcoming.

Felix Brinkmann, a native of Latvia, escaped death for a year while he was in the Nazis' Mauthausen, Ebensee and Auschwitz concentration camps. Five times he had been slated for the gas chambers, but each time he used his fluency in German to talk his way out.

After the war ended, he was stunned to discover that his wife, who had also been shipped to Auschwitz, was alive and well in Poland.

The Brinkmanns immigrated to America, where Felix spent years in the bar and nightclub business, co-founding in 1971 Adam's Apple disco in Manhattan.

In recent years, he had served as the real estate manager of a mixed-use building in the Bronx, working "seven days a week, without fail," said his son Rick Brinkman, who spells his last name differently than his father.

On Thursday, the building's superintendent grew concerned when Brinkmann did not show up to work. He notified Brinkmann's son and received permission to enter the father's apartment, where he had lived alone since his wife died last year.

Brinkmann's body was found lying face down in his bedroom, his hands bound, his body showing blunt-force trauma wounds, police said. Brinkmann's blue 2009 Honda Civic may have been stolen and a safe in his apartment tampered with, police said.

A police spokesman said authorities were looking for "a man and a woman" in connection with the homicide.

Rick Brinkman speculated that the killing was random in nature. "Anybody who knew him really liked him," the son said. "He was not the kind of guy who had enemies."

The spider plant

Firstly we have the Spider Plant, which is no way near as creepy as it sounds! This stimulating plant is perfect to place on high shelves because of their far reaching leaves – so they can be easily placed within the office without being hidden. It is also very easy to care for it, as it does not require much sunlight or maintenance. However, the main appeal is that it will eliminate air pollutants – in addition to their efficiency at reducing CO2 levels, they are also able to clear dust and other unwanted particulate matter that is often abundant in the workplace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279045-739559f14e6c17c3c76b395bac221516.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002265 00000000000 014711  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Grateful Dead Release _Formerly The Warlocks_ Box Set

Back in October of 1989 the Grateful Dead preceded their five night Meadowlands Arena run with two stealth shows at Hampton Coliseum. Billed as Formerly The Warlocks, tickets for these dates were only available locally less than two weeks before the shows. These gigs, on Sunday October 8 and Monday 9, were notable not only for the group’s alias but also for the music that ensued. On the first night, the band opened its second set with the “Help On The Way”>“Slipknot!”>“Franklin’s Tower” combo, last performed in 1985. The Dead then returned to encore with the a cappella “We Bid You Goodnight,” which had been out of rotation for over a decade. Many fans left Hampton after the Sunday performance, assuming that they had seen the bust outs of the run. However, the group returned on Monday to deliver the first “Dark Star” in well over five years. The band encored that night with the American Beauty track “Attics Of My Life,” last played on September 27, 1972.

These two shows are now being made available as a box set. Formerly The Warlocks can now we pre-ordered at Dead.net, with a September 7 release date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0279217-bf9bc26f8ecee1cd6a7f33f5bb02654c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005416 00000000000 015507  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Former Fine Gael and Independent TD Peter Mathews has died aged 65. He had been ill with cancer for some time.

Mr Mathews was elected as Fine Gael TD at the 2011 general election in the Dublin South constituency. He had been a vocal commentator on the financial crisis, writing for newspapers and appearing on radio and television regularly.

He lost the Fine Gael whip in 2013 when he opposed the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Bill, citing his opposition to abortion. He later left the Fine Gael party and despite his illness, stood as an Independent candidate in last year’s election.

However, with his constituency reduced after a boundary revision, he failed to retain his Dáil seat. He remained an occasional visitor to Leinster House.

He was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in 2016 after a routine check-up.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny said he was saddened to hear of his untimely death. He had “served his constituents with commitment and energy.”

“The economic crisis prompted him to get involved in politics and he had very strongly held views on how that crisis, particularly in the banking sector, should be addressed.

“Peter Mathews bore his illness with courage and resilience,” he said.

Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin said Mr Mathews “ was great company and always had time for everyone...He was a diligent and dedicated public representative who worked tirelessly on behalf of his constituents. Peter was a principled man who was not afraid to stand up for what he believed in.”

Fine Gael TD for Dublin-Rathdown, Josepha Madigan, described Mr Mathews as “ clear and outspoken in his views and was very well loved by the people of his constituency in Dublin South.”

Her party colleague, MEP Brian Hayes, tweeted that Mr Mathews will be “sadly missed”, while Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar tweeted “Ireland has lost one of its true gentleman”.

Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond said Mr Mathews was “an absolute gentleman” and that he “thoroughly enjoyed his company whether it was social or political. Peter and I regularly had lively discussions on political matters but never once fell out.”

His colleague, Fine Gael Senator Frank Feighan, described Mr Mathews as “passionate,articulate and extremely helpful when advice was sought”.

Fine Gael TDfor Dubin-Fingal Alan Kelly expressed his condolences to the family and friends of his former colleague.

Mr Mathews attended Gonzaga College and went on to study Commerce in University College Dublin. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant and worked for Coopers and Lybrand (now PwC) and also ICC bank, for 20 years. He left ICC bank in 1998 to set up his independent consultancy business.

Mr Mathews passed away on Monday night.

He is survived by his wife Susan and their four adult children.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0279194-0e72451d3667bd95d9ee43ff9822f950.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006652 00000000000 015024  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In the bone-dry coastal desert of northern Peru, the ancient Moche sculpted and painted intricate murals on the adobe walls of the site now known as Huaca de la Luna (Temple of the Moon). Created between A.D. 100 and 800, the images hold intriguing clues to a mysterious people who left no written texts to help explain their beliefs and customs.

Now, a composite photo in super high resolution has captured one of those murals in amazing detail, allowing anyone with a computer to zoom in for close-up views of individual figures. (Click here for the interactive version of the photo.)

Covering 200 square feet (19 square meters) in the corner of one of the temple's plazas, the polychrome relief vividly portrays scenes from the spiritual life of the Moche. Human sacrifice, for instance, was a common ritual in this culture. It's shown here in mid-action, with the perpetrator thrusting a weapon at the defenseless victim, who is splayed on his back. In other spots, warriors appear in various poses that must have held great meaning centuries ago—grasping an iguana by its tail, brandishing a weapon in each hand, and holding up a decapitated head. (See more pictures of a Moche sacrifice chamber.)

The mural includes many animals—fish and crayfish (presumably from the nearby Moche River), as well as snakes, scorpions, monkeys, foxes, buzzards, an unidentified feline, and dogs that appear to be barking. It also may show scenes from daily life—people capturing birds with nets, fishing from a kind of reed boat still used locally today, even smelting gold.

The Moche are known for their masterful ceramics and metalwork. Their intricate artifacts of gold are best known from the treasures uncovered in 1987 in the tomb of the Lord of Sipan, the richest unlooted grave found to date in the New World.

At Huaca de la Luna the wall with the wealth of motifs caught the eye of Fabio Amador—a senior program officer in National Geographic's department of research, conservation, and exploration—while he was visiting grantees in the field.

It seemed like the perfect subject for a gigapixel image, a panorama made of billions of pixels that capture every element in sharp detail. Using a process developed by GigaPan Systems, Amador took hundreds of photos with a camera mounted on a robotic tripod. Those photos were then stitched together seamlessly with proprietary software.

"I really wanted to get to the detail, the design elements, without losing their placement in the larger context of the mural," Amador says.

Archaeologists have been using gigapixel photography as a scientific aid since GigaPan was founded in 2008. The technology has helped record a Paleolithic site in southwestern France and the site of a Macedonian cult on the Greek island of Samothrace, for example.

Amador sees two large roles for gigapixel photography in this field: first, facilitating research by allowing experts to take a close look at sites anywhere in the world; and second, giving the public a heightened appreciation of those sites. "The modern archaeologist is capable of not only making the discovery, but also communicating to the world the beauty of the past," he says.

Excavations began at Huaca de la Luna long before archaeology was a modern discipline. When German archaeologist Max Uhle did the first work there between 1898 and 1899, it was more adventure than science.

Since 1991, an international team of experts has been studying the Huaca de la Luna murals in depth.                                                                                      0279209-38d5e4eda9960eb22c5bb417d6c40837.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002450 00000000000 015125  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Normally, we wouldn’t cover sports related stories here but since I’m an avid Red Bulls fan here in New York, I couldn’t help but get behind this story. Luke Rodgers has played one season with the New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer in the USA, and before he even arrived he had some Visa issues. Rodgers went on to have a great first year with MLS and was nominated for the Newcomer of the Year Award with the league. Now, with the Visa issuance being delayed yet again and an appeal hearing coming down sometime next week, it’s an important time for Rodgers. Here is how you can help.

Set up by Ian Erickson, a Red Bulls fan, a petition was created to give Luke Rodgers some leverage in his appeal meeting at the US Embassy in London in early March. In under a week, the petition has generated 420 signatures so far and the desired goal of 1,000 would be much better. Now here is your chance to make a difference for a player who works hard, has a family to take care of, and deserves the right to be here in this country. Isn’t this the “Land of the Free” after all? Please sign and spread the word! Facebook, Twitter, or any other social networking site to get the word out. Thanks!

Pjöngjang (dpo) - Renewed sabre-rattling in North Korea as dictator Kim Jong-un announces on state television that if pushed, he would be willing to use the most dreadful threat of all time. This applies if the international community does not start to take notice of North Korea’s threats to date. Military experts are taking the threat of the threat seriously since nobody knows the full scale of North Korea’s arsenal of intimidating statements.Kim Jong-un is quoted as saying, “All threats ever issued pale in comparison to this threat. It is the mother of all threats. I am prepared to use it against our enemies if all existing sanctions against North Korea are not immediately repealed!”According to a statement by the North Korean news agency KCNA, 1,000 scientists spent 50 years developing this threat. Over 900 of them died in the process.No one is certain of the exact content of the threat. However, military experts suspect a threat on the scale of ‘destroying the sun’ or ‘employing genetically modified laser tigers’.Other experts, with a more philosophical leaning, posit that threatening the mother of all threats is, in itself, the mother of all threats. In this case, the scale of the terror is limited only by the recipient’s own imagination.The USA and South Korea reacted to the news this lunchtime. The Defence Ministers of these allied nations threatened North Korea, saying that if the country should go through with its threat and employ the mother of all threats, they will immediately threaten exactly the same – but twice as bad.Read the German version HERE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279245-eebd9957bc63fee7024562c01040a552.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004546 00000000000 015043  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        This bulletin was originally published on RadioReference.com by users of the site. A brief section of the document has been redacted at the request of the Maryland Coordination and Analysis Center to remove personal information related to non-law enforcement staff.

(U//FOUO//LES) During several recent contacts with criminal gang members, an identified Maryland law enforcement agency has heard their radio transmissions broadcast over a suspect’s smartphone. In one incident, officers pursuing a suspect on foot overheard the suspect listening to the pursuing officers’ radio transmission over a smartphone. The radio broadcasts of the agency’s primary secure law enforcement channel had an approximate delay of three seconds on the suspect’s smartphone.

(U//FOUO//LES) Further investigation revealed that the general public, as well as criminal gang members and associates, are utilizing the website www.radioreference.com to listen to law enforcement secure channels streaming via the Internet. Registration and access to the site is free, with advanced features available to premium subscribers. A customer is able to search radio frequencies throughout the country by state, metro area, city and/or zip code. The website advertises a search for trunked frequencies as well. The frequencies are obtained over the Internet and any cell phone that has web access can listen in.

(U) As of 2010, there were at least 20 scanner applications (apps) on the market for download to smartphones. Some examples are iScanner and 5-0 Radio Police Scanner for iPhones and Police Stream for Android phones. The 5-0 Radio Police Scanner app advertises access to police, fire, aircraft, railroad, and marine frequencies. These apps can be downloaded to the smartphone and at a touch of the screen will allow the user to listen to emergency frequencies via their mobile device.

(U//FOUO//LES) This situation presents a concern for officer safety. A criminal who is able to listen to law enforcement radio transmissions in near-real time could use the information to further their criminal activity, hide criminal activity, assist in a get-away, gain investigative information or set up an ambush position. Law enforcement needs to maintain a heightened awareness that criminals may exploit emerging technology in order to gain an upper-hand during the planning, execution, and escape phases of their crimes.                                                                                                                                                          0279255-14b51ee5c57fbcb5ecf39c7fd7ff5f06.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011550 00000000000 015521  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        These days, it’s hard to talk about Overwatch without mentioning its ongoing struggles with sexism, racism, griefing, match throwing, and worse. At BlizzCon, game director Jeff Kaplan told Kotaku that fighting toxicity is now more of a priority than ever, to the point that Blizzard has formed a “strike team” to do so.



In recent months, the Overwatch team has taken flack for perceived foot-dragging in its efforts to stop players from treating each other like garbage. Not only did common-sense features like detailed report categories, notifications when Blizzard’s taken action against somebody you’ve reported, and reporting on consoles take multiple months too many to make it into the game, but Kaplan recently put out a strangely defensive video in which he explained that playing whack-a-mole with the game’s more toxic elements takes away from time the team could be spending on new content and features. Despite all that, Kaplan told me that turning the tide in the fight against toxicity is just as important as adding new characters and levels to the popular team shooter.



“We’re not sitting here with our heads in the sand,” said Kaplan. “You have concerns, and your concerns are now one of our top priorities. If that means the thing we’re gonna focus on as much as Moira and Blizzard World is toxicity, then we’re gonna do it.”



Blizzard has created an anti-toxicity “strike team” made up of game designers, support staff, analytics people, and a special group called “Risk” that fights cheating and hacking, Kaplan said. The team is currently devising a series of short, medium, and long-term plans to make Overwatch’s community better. While Kaplan said he could not go into too much detail on what exactly the team is doing for fear that this would give griefers more information to game the system more effectively, he offered a couple examples.

In light of criticisms that reported players get off easy, often facing only chat silences and brief suspensions before returning to play, Kaplan said the plan is to err on the side of stricter moderation going forward.



“We’re starting to action less toward silences and more toward suspensions,” he said. “If somebody’s doing bad behavior, just silencing them can sometimes convince them to do things like throw matches and grief in other ways. If you keep exemplifying bad behavior, we’re gonna have you leave the game [permanently].”



“It’s kind of like ‘The road to hell is paved with best intentions.’”

He also pointed to a notification system that’ll tell players when somebody they’ve reported has been hit with some kind of action. Currently, Kaplan said, between 20 and 30,000 test players receive notifications via email, but it won’t be long before notifications start showing up for all players in-game (as opposed to via email). The goal, he explained, is to make it clear that reporting does something and, to the reported, that their actions have tangible consequences.

In the longer term, the strike team is also looking at machine learning as a possible complement to other elements of its anti-toxicity apparatus. At the moment, Blizzard is trying it out in the chats of both Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, using it to determine words and phrases frequently associated with toxicity. Kaplan says similarly toxic sentiments are aired in both games’ chats.



It remains disheartening, however, that things ever managed to get this bad in the first place. Kaplan said that he wished the team had put more of a focus on heading these issues off at the pass early on, but stressed that he did not feel the team was simply being lackadaisical or negligent when it failed to implement features like console reporting functionality in Overwatch’s early days.

“It’s kind of like ‘The road to hell is paved with best intentions,’ he said. Console reporting was a big point of discussion early on, he said, but the team decided against it because, at the time, it would have required all console Overwatch players to also create Battle.net accounts, a small but annoying barrier to entry. But, I noted, that simply meant that the Overwatch team had dodged a bullet, only to get hit by a truck later on.



“That’s where we’re at now,” Kaplan replied with a sigh. Best intentions, indeed. Kaplan feels like the team is on the right track now, though, and he wants people to know that this is not a problem they’re tackling reluctantly.

“People are fired up” about this issue, Kaplan said. He used as an example a particular server programmer on the team who has recently become laser-focused on using the fact that he knows the code better than just about anybody else to deal with toxicity. “Nobody had to direct him on that,” Kaplan said. “There’s a lot of passion on the team to tackle that right now.”                                                                                                                                                        0279289-665594862d23942b169ce6a208f18f52.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003465 00000000000 014601  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A statistic that’s oft-repeated in pro-choice circles is that 87 percent of counties in the United States do not have an abortion provider. What this means practically is that even though abortion is legal in this country, if you’re a poor woman who lives hours from the nearest provider, it’s nearly impossible to obtain one. However, a new service that’s available in Iowa—abortion through tele-medicine—could make access a possibility for women in the most anti-choice states. This ABC News story explains how the process works:



A woman seeking an abortion via telemedicine has an ultrasound performed by a trained technician, receives information about medical abortion and signs a standard informed consent for the abortion.

Once that is complete, a physician steps in via teleconference. The doctor reviews the woman’s medical history and ultrasound images, and once it is determined that she is eligible—up to nine weeks pregnant and not an ectopic pregnancy – she has time to ask questions.

Then, the doctor enters a computer passcode to remotely open a drawer at the clinic containing two pills. She then swallows the mifepristone, under the doctor’s supervision, and then is instructed to take four additional tablets of misoprostol within the next 24 to 48 hours. The actual abortion happens at home.

This makes life incredibly easy for patients, not just because it gives women who are far from a provider access to one, but it also allows women to avoid embattled abortion clinics where they might have to contend with furious protestors. Predictably, some of the most anti-choice states (Arizona, Kansas, North Dakota, Nebraska and Tennessee, according to ABC News) have already passed laws restricting telemedical abortion. Still, for women who need abortions in provider deserts, this is fantastic news.                                                                                                                                                                                                           0279229-27fcc23891ce40f83c81d12af7a37457.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000014167 00000000000 015057  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        On the day of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Larry Keane, watched the news in disbelief.

Down the halls at the gun industry group’s offices, he could hear his co-workers crying as the TV showed the school’s smashed windows and clusters of terrified children.

It had all happened fewer than two miles from his desk.

“There aren’t even words to describe the unbelievable coincidence that this occurred where we happened to be located,” Keane said in an interview with The Hill last week.

The shooting at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn. — where the NSSF has been based for more than two decades — was among the deadliest in history, leaving 20 children and six educators dead in addition to the gunman and his mother.

For the firearms industry group in the center of the small New England town, it was a tragic irony that forced them into the epicenter of a nationwide gun debate. It also left the gun lobby with a tarnished reputation, accused of profiting from deadly weapons, that it is still trying to repair.

Until Dec. 14, 2012, the NSSF had faced little public scrutiny as it lobbied on behalf of more than 10,000 gun manufacturers, retailers and ranges. As a much smaller — and quieter — counterpart to the National Rifle Association, it wasn’t hard to avoid attention.

In the two years since the shooting, the NSSF has doubled down on its safety programs, including efforts to improve the country’s background check system.

“We’re not bad neighbors, we’re not the bad guys,” said Keane, who splits his time between his Newtown and his Washington, D.C., office — about a 10-minute walk from the Senate’s entrance.

The protests outside the NSSF started just days after the final funeral parade passed through town.

Word had spread quickly that the yellow office building at the corner traffic light was home to a lobbying group that aimed to make it easier for companies to buy and sell guns.

Hundreds of moms and dads from newly formed groups like Newtown Action Alliance brought their kids and picketed outside for hours. They wore “Sandy Hook” green and held up signs and photos of the slain children and teachers.

NSSF officials mostly kept their heads down.

The group released a statement expressing sympathy for the families of the victims, but initially stayed clear of issues like magazine limits, semi-automatic weapon bans and background checks, a sharp contrast to the NRC’s reaction.

“We were mindful of where we were located. We were mindful of the sensitivities,” Keane said. “We tried to be respectful and we limited what we said in the immediate aftermath.”

Meanwhile, on the national stage, the group’s presence was growing fast: After spending less than a half-million dollars in 2011, its spending surged to $2.5 million in 2013 and then $3 million last year as a sea of new regulations put lobbying in high demand.

Staff members at the NSSF, including Keane, believe much of the anger directed at their organization over the last two years is misguided.

Keane, the son of a New York City police officer, stressed that the group has been “a leader in promoting firearms safety” since its founding in the 1960s. He pointed to Project ChildSafe, through which the NSSF worked with 15,000 law enforcement agencies — including in Newtown — before the shooting.

Perhaps the NSSF’s most surprising safety effort — at least, to gun control advocates — is its campaign to improve background checks.

All gun dealers are required to use the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to search for records that would make potential buyers ineligible to own a gun, such as those convicted of a crime. The system is notoriously unreliable, plagued by a lack of data and governed by a patchwork of state laws — problems that all sides of the gun debate have long tried to fix.

Still, Keane argues that his organization is the only one with “boots on the ground.”

“People will talk about it, most notably the Bloomberg-funded groups, but they don’t actually do anything,” he said. “We put our money where our mouth is.”

The FixNICS program has made big strides since the shooting: the NSSF claimed victories in about 12 of 15 states where it has paid lobbyists in the past year. Funding is also flowing at the federal level, with Congress setting aside $58 million in grants in 2015, its largest-ever pool of funding.

“It’s unfortunate that we don’t get any credit for it, but were going to keep doing it,” Keane said.

Po Murray, the co-founder of Newtown Action Alliance, said while she also supports strengthening background checks, she distrusts the NSSF because she believes its “primary goal is to sell more guns.”

“They’re the ones that rebranded the semi-automatic assault rifles,” she said. “NSSF is the gun lobby.”

She criticized the group for helping to block the Senate’s 2013 background check bill. An amendment to that bill, offered by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), would have closed the “gun show loophole” that allows dealers selling firearms at gun shows to skip background checks. The amendment and the bill failed. The NSSF said at the time it opposed the Manchin-Toomey measure because enforcing the gun show regulation would draw needed resources away from NSSF-supported efforts to strengthen existing background check laws, a stance Keane reiterated nearly to years later.

Keane reiterated that stance, saying the industry didn’t support Manchin-Toomey because it drained resources without trying to repair the already broken system.

Other than the regular protests outside the NSSF, Murray’s only interaction with the gun industry group came at a friend’s Christmas party in New Hampshire. Keane, who also owns a house in New Hampshire, happened to be at the same party.

Murray said she immediately introduced herself and “broke the party etiquette” by talking about the NSSF.

Keane remembers that their conversation was “cordial,” adding that it was the typical “small world” story he’d grown accustomed to while living in Newtown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0279095-5098d17bacfef4a2022e326116434ae0.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000015736 00000000000 015033  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Madeline Neumann is shown in this 2007 file photo participating in Wausau's Chalk Fest.

The state Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the convictions of a Weston couple who prayed for their dying daughter instead of seeking medical care for her.

Dale and Leilani Neumann's 11-year-old daughter, Madeline Kara Neumann, died of untreated diabetes March 23, 2008. When she stopped breathing, her parents and their friends who were praying over her called 911.

The couple were convicted of reckless homicide in separate trials with different juries in 2009 and each sentenced to 180 days in jail and 10 years of probation. The jail sentences were postponed while the Neumanns appealed.

The case centered on whether the spiritual healing exception under the state child abuse and neglect law shields parents from other kinds of prosecutions. The court found it does not. The justices voted 6-1 to uphold the convictions, with Justice David Prosser dissenting.

"The decision essentially gutted the faith healing privilege under the child abuse statute," said attorney Steven Miller, who represented Dale Neumann.

Miller said the court made it clear that a person could be charged even if they were engaging in activity protected by the faith-healing statute and that parents cannot rely on that faith-healing privilege.

At least one lawmaker wants to eliminate the spiritual healing exception.

State Rep. Terese Berceau (D-Madison) said Wednesday she will re-introduce legislation in the coming week that would remove the prayer exception to Wisconsin's child abuse and neglect statutes. She originally introduced the bill in 2009, but delayed reintroduction until after the state Supreme Court's decision.

The proposed legislation does not remove the right of an adult to reject medical treatment for faith healing.

The Neumanns have not yet discussed or decided if they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, Miller said.

"They lost their child. Obviously, that was an extreme tragedy. They never expected that. To deal with a criminal trial, felony convictions and a very long appeal process, it's been painful," he said.

If they did appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and the court accepted the case, it would be the first time the highest court addressed a faith-healing case involving children, said Shawn Francis Peters, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor and author of "When Prayer Fails: Faith Healing, Children and the Law."

About a dozen children die annually nationwide when parents rely on faith healing instead of medical treatment, Peters said.

"It kind of questions our assumptions about the effectiveness of law to control behavior when it's religiously motivated behavior," he said. "For many people, adherence to their faith supersedes their adherence to the laws of the state."

The Neumanns' attorneys had asked the state Supreme Court to reverse the convictions, arguing that state law protects prayer healers. The Neumanns do not belong to any identifiable church or religious organization but identify as Pentecostals and believe there are spiritual root causes to sickness, according to court records.

Specifically, the Neumanns' attorneys argued that the parents' due process rights were violated because they were not duly notified that they could be criminally liable if the prayer treatment failed to save their child.

The couple also took issue with jury instructions, and Dale Neumann argued that his jury was biased because it knew his wife already had been convicted.

An assistant attorney general told the justices that the couple placed their daughter at substantial risk of death. A parent who prays over an ailing child can't be charged with child abuse, but the state argued if the child dies, that protection doesn't apply.

In the majority opinion, the justices agreed with the prosecutor that the treatment-through-prayer provision applies only to charges of criminal child abuse and does not create a blanket protection from criminal prosecution for a parent.

The Neumanns also had argued that they did not know their daughter was reaching a point of "substantial risk of death" as described in the reckless homicide law because her symptoms were hard to identify.

"If we were to adopt the parents' reasoning, no prayer-treating parent would know what point is beyond 'a substantial risk of death' until the child actually stopped breathing and died," the majority wrote.

Miller said the Neumanns were charged with a crime of omission and the state was required to prove the couple had a duty to act. The majority opinion, however, doesn't fully address that, he said.

"When did the Neumanns have a duty to provide professional medical care? You'll see (the majority opinion) never really answered the question other than to say maybe always," Miller said.

Prosser raised that problem in his dissenting opinion.

"The Neumanns claim that the reckless homicide statute is too murky to give sufficient notice as to when parent choice of treatment through prayer becomes illegal. Given the nature of (her) illness as well as the imprecision in the statutory language, I agree. There is a due process problem here," he wrote.

Peters said that argument — "We knew our kid was sick but didn't know how sick" — is one parents often make in these cases.

"They always say that. Courts are never convinced by that and juries aren't often convinced by that," Peters said.

The facts in the death of Madeline, known as Kara to her family and friends, are not disputed. She died at 3:30 p.m. March 23, 2008 — Easter Sunday — after having gradually worsening symptoms of exhaustion and dehydration for a few weeks. Experts at the trials testified that she would have appeared healthy as late as the Thursday before she died.

On Saturday, she stayed home from work at her family's coffee shop and slept all day. When her mother checked on her, the girl's legs were skinny and blue. Her parents sent an email at 4:58 p.m. Saturday asking people to pray for her daughter.

During the trial, Kara's brother testified he believed she was in a coma, but others testified that they did not sense any danger in her condition. Leilani Neumann's sister-in-law in California called 911 after hearing about her niece's condition. When paramedics tried to measure the 11-year-old's blood sugar, it was too high for a monitor to read.

A pediatric endocrinologist testified that diabetic ketoacidosis has a 99.8% survival rate, and Kara's chances of survival were high until "well into the day of her death."

All the Neumann children were born in a hospital and vaccinated, but about a decade before the girl's death, Dale Neumann believed his back pain was healed through prayer. They decided not to go to doctors for treatment anymore, believing they would be "putting the doctor before God."

The Neumann case followed the pattern of other such cases, Peters said.

"(U)sually it's the garden-variety illness that most pediatricians can diagnose and treat in a snap," he said.

Handtekeningenactie voor FHICT

In de Weird Week moeten alle ICT-studenten van Fontys een filmpje maken. De week was origineel enkel voor ICT & Media Design-studenten, die zich inderdaad zich bezig houden met media zoals filmpjes. Nu moeten de richtingen Software Engineering, Technology en Business ook meedoen, ondanks dat het totaal geen relatie heeft met hun studie.

Er zijn studenten die de Weird Week leuk en/of leerzaam vinden, maar de meesten vind het een verspilling van tijd, geld en moeite. Het belangrijkste probleem met de 'experimentele' weird week is dat het geen nut heeft voor alle niet-Media studenten en er tijd wordt afgenomen van de gewone lesstof.

Ook vallen studenten over een hoop andere problemen:

Het programma werd pas bekend gemaakt na het begin van de week, wat vooruit plannen onmogelijk maakt.

Er wordt valse en misleidende informatie gegeven om ons bang te maken zodat we komen: er wordt gezegd dat de week "net als een gewone lesweek" verplicht is, terwijl gewone lesweken niet verplicht zijn[2]; zelfs al was er een aanwezigheidsplicht, dan vervalt die sowieso doordat er opnames worden gemaakt[3]; er wordt gezegd dat er 12 studiepunten vastzitten aan de week, terwijl 1 studiepunt ongeveer 28 werkuren (SBU's) moeten zijn (maar dat weten de meeste studenten niet en dus geloven veel studenten dat[1]); er wordt gezegd dat bij je PO-assessment wordt bekeken wat je hebt geleerd en welke talenten je hebt ontdekt, en op die manier wordt de week beoordeeld, maar dat hoeft helemaal niet[5]; en als je ergens op beoordeeld wordt bij Fontys, dan moet van te voren duidelijk worden gemaakt waarop in het blokboek[4]. Deze Weird Week komt niet voor in vrijwel elk blokboek (enkel dat van ICT & Media Design), en toch claimt de Weird Week organisatie dat we erop beoordeeld worden.

Het WiFi-netwerk is onbruikbaar om op te werken: het werkt totaal niet, valt regelmatig weg, of (als je geluk hebt) is zo snel als WiFi in de Trein.

Er wordt gevraagd of we toestemming geven om in beeld te komen, maar nog voordat die toestemming gegeven is zijn we al op TV te zien.

Het formulier ('verklaring van geen bezwaar') om aan te geven dat jouw product gebruikt mag worden door Fontys is ook gelijk het formulier voor dat jouw hoofd gebruikt mag worden door Fontys waar ze maar willen. Als je dat niet wilt, kun je dus eigenlijk niet meedoen. Dat in combinatie met de illusie dat het verplicht is en er een punt aan hangt is chantage.

Wil je naar je eigen werk komen kijken tijdens de eindexpositie op vrijdagavond? Dat is dan €5,63 plus de algemene voorwaarden en het privacybeleid van Eventbrite accepteren. Je accepteert dus, per privacybeleid van Eventbrite artikel 4.4, dat je spam zult ontvangen tesamen met je ticket om naar je eigen werk te mogen kijken.

Deze problemen zijn allemaal dingen die Fontys had kunnen voorkomen en kan verbeteren bij een volgende keer. Echter is het grootste punt nog dat de hele week niks toevoegt aan het onderwijs voor drie van de vier hoofdrichtingen. Men wil geen volgende keer.

Wij hebben ons hier niet voor ingeschreven en lesgeld voor betaald. Enige transparantie over dergelijke 'experimenten' is gewenst zodat er inspraak en een publieke discussie kan zijn voordat alles al voor ons geregeld is.

Voetnoten

[1] Op social media zijn er discussies over geweest en in mijn eigen groep waren verschillende mensen onder de indruk dat er werkelijk 12 EC's in die week zaten.

[2] Nergens staat dat het verplicht is. Het Onderwijs- en Examenregelement (OER) zegt enkel in artikel 12 lid 7 dat een 'student die zich heeft aangemeld voor een onderwijsactiviteit neemt de verplichting op zich te voldoen aan de eisen die worden gesteld voor deelname aan deze onderwijsactiviteit'. Deze eisen zijn vervolgens te vinden in het blokboek, aldus artikel 12 lid 1: 'De onderwijsactiviteiten worden vermeld in de blokboeken van de onderwijsblokken. Deze blokboeken worden gepubliceerd op het intranet [uiterlijk] 1 week voor de start van een onderwijsblok'. De hele Weird Week is geen onderwijsactiviteit volgens alle blokboeken (behalve die van ICT & Media Design) en dus mag het niet verplicht zijn noch beoordeeld worden.

Nanterre (France) (AFP) - French judges investigating claims that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was murdered have closed the case without bringing any charges, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.

"At the end of the investigation... it has not been demonstrated that Mr Yasser Arafat was murdered by polonium-210 poisoning," the three judges ruled, according to the prosecutor at Nanterre court near Paris.

The decision was blasted as "fundamentally biased" by lawyers for Arafat's widow Suha and rejected by the Palestinian Authority's own inquiry committee.

Arafat died in Percy military hospital near Paris aged 75 in November 2004 after developing stomach pains while at his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Many Palestinians accuse Israel of poisoning Arafat, a charge flatly denied by the Jewish state.

Arafat's widow has claimed he was poisoned, possibly by highly radioactive polonium.

But the judges ruled it out, saying there was "not sufficient evidence of an intervention by a third party who could have attempted to take his life," the prosecutor said.

Suha Arafat filed suit in 2012 at the Nanterre court.

The same year, Arafat's tomb in Ramallah was opened for a few hours to allow three teams of French, Swiss and Russian investigators to collect around 60 samples.

Three French judges concluded their investigations in April and sent their findings to the Nanterre prosecutor, who recommended in July that the case be dropped.

- Palestinians undeterred -

A centre in the Swiss city of Lausanne had tested biological samples taken from Arafat's belongings that were given to his widow after his death, and found "abnormal levels of polonium."

But it stopped short of saying that he had been poisoned by the substance.

French experts found that the isotopes polonium-210 and lead-210, found in Arafat's grave and in the samples, were of "an environmental nature," Nanterre prosecutor Catherine Denis said in April.

Lawyers for Arafat's widow said the investigation had been "fundamentally biased" and accused the judges of closing the probe too quickly.

"The lack of investigation leads inevitably to the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence," the lawyers said, calling for more experts to be questioned.

The head of the Palestinian Authority's inquiry committee on Wednesday refused to accept the judges' conclusions.

The Palestinian committee has still not presented its conclusions on the death of the veteran leader, a joint winner of the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize.

"We'll continue our investigation to reach the killer of Arafat, until we know how Arafat was killed," Tawfiq Tirawi told AFP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279296-00ab196a66e2edbcdf9630f99758ba1b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003005 00000000000 015266  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Today our League of Legends team says goodbye to a teammate but also a good friend, Joe 'Voyboy' Esfahani﻿. A few days ago Voyboy decided to part ways with the team, which left us without a top lane player. Our team had to look for a replacement and decided that Alberto 'Crumbzz' Rengifo is a great player to join our ranks.

Crumbzz is an all-round player and our team is confident that he'll be able to be a solid top lane player in our roster. As announced earlier today our team is going to Korea during the summer where they'll be staying in the OGN House together. This will be a great opportunity to smoothen their teamplay and maintain their A-game.

Voyboy had this to say about his move to CLG: “With a heavy heart I'll be leaving Team Dignitas, but I am confident in my former team's ability to rise to the occasion and become just as strong as before. Therefore, it is with great excitement that I will be joining the roster of Counter Logic Gaming to fill the Top Lane role. It is my absolute intent that CLG will be as strong as ever going into the Season 2 Championships and I am grateful for this opportunity that I have been given. Thank you.”

Our new addition Crumbzz wanted to say the following:

﻿"I am very pleased to be brought aboard Team Dignitas, I must say I was lured by imaqtpie"s hair, but that doesn't matter since I am here and that's all that counts. I will play in the role I have been placed in to the best of my ability and will hopefully keep Team Dignitas as a powerhouse in League of Legends."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0279266-8a7db2fdb4c4f4ff9e1ad5c3eed08701.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000013300 00000000000 015501  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In a move designed to draw attention to the genocide in Darfur, in 2008 a young art student took the decision to juxtapose an image of a starving child with a Louis Vuitton-inspired bag. The French fashion giant responded by sending in their lawyers in pursuit of crushing damages. This week, however, they lost not only the case, but the all-important PR battle.

Readers may recall the plight of Nadia Plesner, the Danish artist who in 2008 started a campaign to raise awareness of the ongoing genocide in Darfur and raise money for the countless victims there.

“I started this campaign because of the distorted way the media prioritizes between big and small world news,” Nadia told TorrentFreak. “How can Paris Hilton make more front covers than the genocide in Darfur? So, I ‘pimped’ a victim, to see if it worked. And it did!”

‘Pimp’ in this case meant the addition of a Louis Vuitton-inspired bag to Nadia’s artwork, provocatively placed on the arm of a starving child. It was used in her painting Darfurnica and also adorned t-shirts which were sold to raise money for charity.

While the artistic point of the juxtaposition – western excesses and consumer culture versus mass-murder and starvation – would provoke some to donate money to Nadia’s campaign, Louis Vuitton’s cold business reaction was both aggressive and disappointingly predictable. They sent in the lawyers to deal out some destruction of their own, claiming that Nadia had infringed their intellectual property rights.

This decision by the ‘strategists’ at Louis Vuitton, to stop what Nadia believed was her genuine right to freedom of expression, had trouble written all over it from the start. Nevertheless, had the company kept egos in check, maintained some perspective and got Nadia on their side, it might have actually managed to enhance its image. Instead the company fanned the flames. And then poured gas on them.

So, in common with some of the misguided entertainment industry efforts to crush the Jammie Thomas-type minnows of the file-sharing world (nothing like a David v Goliath battle to drum up sympathy for the other side), the whole thing was perfectly primed to backfire through sheer pig-headedness and lack of vision.

Following an initial case which Nadia lost, in February 2011 she discovered that Louis Vuitton had managed to get an ex parte order from a court in The Hague. In plain language that meant the case had already been heard behind her back without giving her a chance to defend herself. Nadia was informed that she was now being fined 5,000 euros per day.

Nadia fought back and in March filed her own lawsuit against Louis Vuitton in an attempt to have the decision overturned. Nadia reports that at the hearing in April, the fashion house got slippery. Their lawyers claimed that they never had a problem with the painting (Darfurnica), only with the use of the bag image in Nadia’s Simple Living campaign logo, a campaign she says was “created in response to the disappearing boundaries between the editorial and advertising departments in the media.”

However, when the judge asked Louis Vuitton’s lawyer why Darfurnica was mentioned in the lawsuit and subsequently outlawed on pain of 5,000 euros per day in fines, Nadia reports that he responded: “You shouldn’t read it like that.”

But it didn’t stop there. Louis Vuitton reportedly told the media that they were willing to drop the case, but behind the scenes Nadia’s lawyers had asked them to withdraw the ex parte order and they had refused.

The judge finished up the hearing by saying he would deliver his ruling early May and this week he was true to his word. The court ruled that the fines against Nadia – which had accumulated to over 500,000 euros – were unlawful. Louis Vuitton was further ordered to pay Nadia’s legal fees.

The fact that Louis Vuitton lost this case is a very, very good thing. Not because they had a hopeless case (trademarks do need to be sensibly protected) but because they deserved defeat for being so incredibly short-sighted.

One might have a little sympathy with the company for not wanting to be associated with genocide, but no sane human being thinks that Louis Vuitton has anything to do with the mess out in Darfur. Furthermore, the company’s supposed marketing geniuses should have been well aware how this would play out, realized they were onto a loser and let the whole issue fade away. Least said, soonest mended.

But instead, in what can only be described as a genius move to generate support for the little guy and reinforce the perception that big companies employ underhand tactics, they went behind Nadia’s back to get an ex parte order. They succeeded in delivering the legal equivalent of a sucker-punch and let’s face it, no one likes a coward.

Then the company rubbed salt in the wounds by demanding 5,000 euros per day in fines against someone who could never afford it – someone raising money for charity, no less. This is not how a company should go about protecting its image.

The net effect is that given some artistic license and taking Darfur out of the equation for just one second, the bag could easily represent corporate greed, its bullying tactics, and all that is bad about they way ‘big business’ is carried out.

The child, conversely, might be representative of the little guy – the Nadia’s of this world – who have their lives turned upside down to ‘protect’ the bottom lines of the big corporations.

While a victory for Nadia is good, given the background and bad PR generated by the case, even a victory for Louis Vuitton would have been a failure for them. Just because someone has the power and means to sue, it doesn’t necessarily follow that they should. Some things are best left alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0279258-97fb14c4f80849794271d11e5165754a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003446 00000000000 014574  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Joy of joys! Bottom, Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson’s riot of slapstick, toilet humour and existentialism is to be revived on BBC2.

However the show’s new series won’t be taking place in Richie and Eddie’s grotty Hammersmith flat. It’ll be set instead on the tropical island which played host to messrs Rich and Hitler in the 1997 Bottom stage show, Hooligan’s Island.

The format for the new series, which is to be called Hooligan’s Island rather than Bottom, will be little-altered though, as the Beeb promises that the pair will still be clobbering one another with large metal objects and chasing women in spite of the island being deserted.

Demonstrating a rapport that remains unchanged since their early Comedy Store days as The Dangerous Brothers, Rik and Ade both greeted the announcement of their reunion with characteristic aplomb.

Rik said: “How much am I getting paid? Are there any birds in it? And that horrific arse-brained Edmondson’s not in it again is he? Oh, God help me… no, no, alright then, I’ll do it.

“That useless, foul smelling waste of space and oxygen is really going to get it this time. This is the big one. Tell the audience to brace themselves.”

His co-star echoed Mayall’s sentiments, in a way, saying: “It’s been a while since I last worked with that complete b****** Rik Mayall and I’m very much looking forward to bashing him about the head with various blunt objects. It’s the only language he understands.”

It’s been 18 years since Bottom was last on air but finally, after almost two decades away, Richie and Eddie will make their TV comeback in 2013. As the Corporation says: “Be afraid. Be very afraid. And a bit bilious.”

Prince was found dead in an elevator in his home Thursday. He was age 57.

Prince was returning from a performance in Atlanta to his home in Minnesota when the flight had to make an emergency landing. Representatives for Prince told the Associated Press that he was treated and released for flu-like symptoms.

According to TMZ sources, Prince was given a "save shot," which is typically used in opiate overdoses.

A cause for his death has not been announced by officials.

While the specific drug is not mentioned in the report, Naloxone is a drug commonly administered to those who have overdosed from prescription opiates or heroin. It is used in extreme cases to prevent a patient from a deadly overdose.

ASHTABULA, Ohio (AP) — A fire chief in northeast Ohio says a drug lab in the room of a nursing home resident has caused a fire that killed one person and injured six others.

Ashtabula (ash-tuh-BYOO'-luh) fire Chief Ron Pristera says the man died Monday, following the Sunday night fire at Park Haven Nursing Home. He says the lab was making methamphetamine.

Pristera says the man was among three residents and two non-residents hospitalized. Two other people were treated at the scene.

A lawyer for the nursing home has declined to comment. Auditor's records show the home was built in 1950 and had 31 rooms. Pristera says 39 names were on its roster.

Methamphetamine is a highly addictive illegal stimulant often cooked in homes with flammable components. State officials say more than 300 meth labs were broken up last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0279297-aaa084a1b1407579322ca542031401a6.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007301 00000000000 014561  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin poses for a snapshot while inside the Lunar Module in this July 1969 NASA image. Aldrin and astronaut Neil Armstrong were the first humans to land and walk on the moon on July 20, 1969.

Famed space man Buzz Aldrin, the second person ever to walk on the moon, is celebrating his 83rd birthday today (Jan. 20) in cosmic style.

Aldrin, who along with Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong boldly walked where no one had before in 1969, is marking his birthday on the road with a trip to England.

"I'm heading home today if the UK weather allows," Aldrin wrote in a post on Twitter today, where he writes as @TheRealBuzz.

This month, Aldrin helped launch the AXE Space Academy, a private spaceflight competition that aims to launch 22 people on suborbital spaceflights as part a deal with the space tourism company Space Expedition Curacao and XCOR Aerospace, which is building the Lynx space plane to be used on the flights.

"Space travel for everyone is the next frontier in the human experience," Aldrin said during the project's launch this month.

But Buzz Aldrin is likely most well-known for his role on NASA's Apollo 11 mission, which made the first manned moon landing on July 20, 1969, when and Armstrong landed on the moon and performed the first moonwalk. Aldrin served as lunar module pilot for the Apollo 11 mission, with Armstrong commanded the mission. Astronaut Michael Collins, meanwhile, served as command module pilot and remained in orbit around the moon during the landing. Armstrong died at age 82 last year.

Aldrin is a retired colonel in the U.S. Air Force and flew combat missions in Korea before joining NASA's astronaut corps in 1963 as one of the space agency's third group of astronauts. He was born Edwin Aldrin ("Buzz" was originally a nickname) in Montclair, N.J., and earned a Ph.D. in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. [Photos of Buzz Aldrin at NASA]

Aldrin's fist space mission, Gemini 12, launched on Nov. 11, 1966, sending him and astronaut James Lovell on a four-day mission to test spacewalk methods, among other goals. It was the final mission of NASA's Gemini program, allowing the space agency to proceed with the Apollo missions that ultimately sent Aldrin to the moon.

Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins launched their Apollo 11 mission on July 16, 1969. Aldrin and Armstrong spent two hours and 15 minutes walking on the lunar surface during their time on the moon. The Apollo 11 crew returned to Earth on July 24, 1969. Five more successful moon landing missions would follow.

Aldrin left NASA in 1971 and retired from the Air Force a year later. Altogether, he logged 289 hours and 53 minutes in space.

Since then, Aldrin has used his moonwalker fame to lobby for continued space exploration, specifically a return to the moon and missions to Mars. He has written several books, including two autobiographies, and made several notable television appearances, with stints on "Dancing with the Stars," "Top Chef," "The Colbert Report" and "Big Bang Theory."

Earlier this year, Aldrin settled his divorce from his wife Lois Driggs Cannon after 23 years of marriage, citing "irreconcilable differences."

Earlier this year I was in communication with superstar Valiant artist, Lewis LaRosa, and his art representative, “Sonic” Dan Moler (Dan also writes the Portfolio Review for All-Comic) about expanding my original art collection. It had just been announced that Valiant Entertainment would release a number of ***NEW*** titles in 2015 (Ninjak, Divinity, Imperium, and Bloodshot: Reborn) and the solicited covers clearly showed that Lewis had completed artwork for each title. Each was beyond amazing, as by the end of 2014, Lewis made a significant shifted artistically in both process and in style. Divinity #1 (LaRosa 1:40 Variant) was (as I have been told) one of Lewis’ covers that he completed with Copic Markers (and blending gray-tones to create texture and depth to each image).

However, as many readers may know, original artwork (especially covers) are seldom cheap, and depending on the artist and/or quality, can quickly drain a bank account of an enthusiastic collector. I ended up buying Lewis’s Ninjak, Imperium, and Bloodshot: Reborn covers, while passing on the (at the time unknown) Divinity cover. Anyone want to guess what I regret not buying? Certainly not my purchase of three of the most iconic Valiant covers to date (I have no regrets whatsoever there), but Lewis’s Divinity cover was later sold to Valiant Entertainment CEO Dinesh Shamdasani (a highly accomplished collector in his own right). You can view this cover on Dinesh’s CAF page here: Divinity #1 (LaRosa 1:40) Original Cover Art.

Simply viewed as a comic book, Divinity was (and is) completely original on a level not commonly seen today (by any publisher honestly). In an industry that all but demands both diversity of characters and new content all of the time, Valiant really nailed it with a Black Russian Cosmonaut who basically becomes God while exploring deep space; gaining the ability to manipulate space, time and reality. You do not get more diverse and/or original than that.

But then something happened; Divinity #1 sold out. It was still February (the month Divinity was released), but copies were selling for 200-300% of cover-price. 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th printings were released, and each sold quite well.

But it was the Divinity #1 (LaRosa 1:40) variant that exploded with speculators and speculators on May 17th, 2015 when Valiant CEO Dinesh Shamdasani wrote the following on Valiant Fans:

“Based on the demand for the 1st print, I’m not surprised to see the 1:40 hit the $140+ range. The print run on the 1:40 is just 350 copies. One of our lowest runs ever (possibly our lowest). We’ve got big plans for Divinity going forward (his quick app in Book of Death #1 was beautifully rendered by Doug this week) and will be announcing several new printings for the current mini soon.”

Almost overnight, the market value for (raw copies) the LaRosa 1:40 Variant shot-up from $100 to $200 to $300 and beyond. Unreal for a book that had just been released earlier that same year. However, the cover stock was very good, and the books graded well at CGC and CBCS. Raw copies were certainly not guaranteed to grade at 9.8, but most did which helped boost confidence with buyers in the raw market who considered each buy as a solid investment. The market really was not expected to become over-saturated with the book, since it was confirmed by Valiant that only 350 exist! Graded sales for 9.8’s have been in the $450-650 range, with a 9.9 selling for $900 over the summer.

In late May (following the 2015 C2E2 in Chicago) Dinesh auctioned a CGC 9.8 Signature Series copy of Divinity #1 (Djurdjevic 1st Print) for a winning bid of $415.

Virtually every regular and/or variant of Divinity that has been graded 9.8 has sold above $100. The 1:10, 1:20, and 1:30 Variants (as expected) typically sell for more. Raw copies of Divinity #2 (LaRosa 1:30 Variant) often sell for $100+.

It should be noted that Divinity #2 (Djurdjevic 1st Print) sold 9,384 copies (source: Comichron March ’15 Sales Records) so it is reasonable that based on those numbers that only 300-400 copies of the Divinity #2 (LaRosa 1:30 Variant) exist in circulation. Remember that Divinity #1 (Djurdjevic 1st Print) sold 12,079 copies (source: Chomichron February ’15 Sales Records) and it has been confirmed that only 350 copies of the Divinity #1 (LaRosa 1:40) exist in circulation. What this means (to me) is that both the LaRosa 1:40 and the LaRosa 1:30 are very close in scarcity, which might not mean much to the average collector today, but might very well mean something in a few months and/or years when copies can not be easily found and prices increase for those that are available.

But while Divinity #2 (LaRosa 1:30 Variant) is a very solid pick for collectors and/or buyers due to its scarcity (almost identical to Divinity #1 (LaRosa 1:40 Variant)), special attention should be given to Divinity #3 (Gill 1:10 Variant) and Divinity #3 (LaRosa 1:20 Variant) for its potential significance as well as scarcity.

Divinity #3 (Djurdjevic 1st Print) sold 9,582 copies (source: Comichon April ’15 Sales Records) which likely translates to 450-500 copies of Divinity #3 (LaRosa 1:20 Variant) and about 950 copies of Divinity #3 (Gill 1:10 Variant). However, there is more to this story than numbers alone…

On September 22nd, 2015 it was reported that Valiant Entertainment is planning to create a ***NEW*** female character / icon that is on par with DC’s Wonder Woman and/or Marvel’s Captain Marvel (source: Bleeding Cool).

Speculators and fans quickly began, well, speculating as to who this will be. Nothing was certain, until Valiant Entertainment Executive Editor Warren Simons tweeted the following on Twitter:

“Here’s a sneak peak of the first page from Divinity II! Scripted by @mattkindt with lovely pencils by @despotting.”

The image clearly depicted a woman on a distant planet, wearing what appears to be a Russian Cosmonaut outfit. This information in itself is only partially interesting, but when reinforced by the Bleeding Cool article, indicated strong evidence that this will be the ***NEW*** female character / icon being created by Valiant.

However, is she “really” new?

The answer is likely both yes and no. Divinity #3 Page #2 shows three Russian cosmonauts together in space at the moment that Divinity becomes, well, Divinity. if you look closely to at the cosmonaut on the right, you will see that artist Trevor Hairsine penciled long eyelashes and slightly slanted eyes to create a feminine appearance for (what has likely been intended to be a prominent female character in the Valiant Universe. While there was no real character development or further information provided at the time, it is HIGHLY REASONABLE to speculate that she is the character we see in the Divinity II preview.

Furthermore, I do not believe in coincidence. Dinesh (despite having hundreds if not thousands of potential pages to choose from) decided at some point to buy Trevor Hairsine’s Divinity #3 Page #2 original art (added in June of 2015) which can be found on Dinesh’s CAF page here: Divinity #3 Page #2.

I strongly speculate that this is not an accident, and that Dinesh invested in this page due to it holding future significance as the 1st appearance of at major female character that will become known in the near future — and we have not even discussed the third and final cosmonaut pictured on the left side of the page…

While this page is clearly unavailable for purchase, Divinity #3 (LaRosa 1:20 Variant) and Divinity #3 (Gill 1:10 Variant) have been somewhat overlooked while the market has been focused on Divinity #1. It appears that Divinity #3 is a sleeper book with a LOT of future potential; both as a comic book and as an investment.

Divinity #4 rounded out the mini-series quite well selling 9,536 copies (source: Comichron May ’15 Sales Records), with Divinity #4 (Guice 1:20 Variant) emerging as the most valuable variant of Divinity #4 which is estimated to have only 480 copies in circulation.

Lastly, fans and readers received the Divinity story they deserved with perhaps one of the greatest story battles of 2015 in the pages of Josh Dysart’s Imperium #7 and 8. Specifically, Imperium #7 sold 6,425 copies (source: Comichron August ’15 Sales Records), and yet featured a 1:20 incentive variant that was almost impossible to find in most LCS’s. With an estimated only 300-350 copies in circulation, Imperium #7 (Tan 1:20 Variant) sold quickly with a market value growth of 150-200% since its released date.

Now is a very good time to pick-up these books while prices are low. The higher variants all have fewer than 500 copies in circulation, and both Divinity #1 and #3 in particular feature first appearances that are (and will be) highly significant to the Valiant Universe for years to come.

With a funded five-movie-deal in place, and the likely reality of expanded visibility by (what will likely be) millions of fans, collectors, readers, and investors in the near and distant future, it seems silly to not buy these books while they are easy to be found and/or obtained.

It is the sort of easy investment move that people later kick themselves for missing out on for no good reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0279307-09328fea13fee5cbd3f893f0fff9880f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004315 00000000000 015371  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Welcome, my friends! Welcome back to All in WDW and welcome to the 4th Annual All in WDW Readers’ Food & Wine Pre-Festival Top 20! 4th?! You bet!

Let’s see a show of hands. Who, out there, remembers last year’s Food & Wine “frolics”? I’ll give you a hint … you did a lot of salivating and a whole lot of voting!

Great! I see quite a few of you out there! Hey! There’s Doug Davis, Dennis Conroy, and John Peters! WDW Main Street Podcast in … da … house!

I love those guys! If you want to hear me talk Food & Wine ’16 on their show, click here!

Now, how many of you are new to All in WDW’s obsession with Food & Wine? Oooh. There’s a lot of you “rookies” this year! That’s outstanding!

Well, to organize my attack on Food & Wine, I annually carve Epcot’s monumental list of Food & Wine entrees down to the 20 dishes that I feel that I will like.

Yes, folks, in the past I used to aim for “25”. In 2016, however, I’m going to dial back the calories and cost to “20”! That list will become my 2016 “menu”!

Why do I do this? Hey! Have you seen the list of entrees this year! There’s nearly 70! I simply can’t eat (or pay for!) that much food!

So, what job do I have in mind for you? We’re going to construct your Food & Wine Pre-Festival “menu”! And, we’re going to do it “All in WDW style”!

That’s right! Polls! You’ve done it quite successfully the past three years … let’s do it again! It’s easy!

Hey! You know what you like! For example, are you going to pick Grilled Shrimp if you’re allergic to shellfish? Will you choose Venison if your favorite character is Bambi?

Let’s have some fun making selections in this – the “1st Round” of voting! Across all of Food & Wine’s marketplaces, which dishes will hit your list?

Which items will you collectively include in the 2016 All in WDW Readers’ Food & Wine Pre-Festival Top 20?!

So, here’s how it works … I present one group below. You can vote for up to FIVE dishes in each group! The Top 5 vote-getters will move forward in our selection process!

Bon appetit, diners! VOTE! VOTE! VOTE for your 5! By the way, if you need a description of the items before you make your choices, check out this link!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279142-cd1cdef91bf07adef308ea796b574733.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010122 00000000000 015340  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        It's still dark when Ronda Brown emerges from her warm car to cross the chilly Westfield Annapolis mall parking lot.

Illuminated by street lamps, a large Academy bus pulls into the stop in front of the JCPenney's at 7 a.m.

Brown pays her $5 — the fee for a one-way trip — and settles into a seat on the empty bus. She keeps her white coat on and begins thumbing her phone. The bus to ride from Annapolis to Baltimore is a larger model with plentiful and comfortable seats.

Both important for 40- to 50-minute drives to Baltimore.

"I used to car pool," Brown said, an employee at the Maryland Higher Education Commission in Baltimore. "(The bus) makes for a better day, besides the financial hit."

Brown is taking the new commuter bus from Annapolis to Baltimore to reach her job in the city. The new bus routes 210 and 215 started March 1, and riders were allowed to use the service for free the first two weeks.

From Annapolis, the Route 210 buses start at 6 a.m. with stops at Westfield Annapolis, West Street and Church Circle, Rowe Boulevard and Taylor Avenue, Medical Parkway, and Harry S. Truman Park and Ride at Riva Road and Truman Parkway.

Route 215 buses take passengers from Baltimore to Annapolis. Both routes have trips returning from their morning destinations starting at about 3 p.m.

Last week marked the first in which riders had to pay. While riders can pay cash, monthly tickets and bulk passes can be bought online at www.mta.commuterdirect.com. Monthly passes are cheaper than paying daily, and the fare depends on distance traveled.

There were two people, Brown and Anthony Reiner, who rode the 7 a.m. bus into Baltimore on a recent Thursday. They used to car pool to work together. The two rode the 4:20 p.m. bus home, which showed up about 10 minutes late to its stop at St. Paul and Fayette streets in downtown Baltimore. Six people rode the round-trip bus back to Annapolis. Most got off at the Westfield Annapolis stop.

Reiner and Brown said it's much easier to take the bus than switching between drivers for car pools. Brown talks on the phone briefly while Reiner enjoys reading The Washington Post. It's the morning that President Donald Trump released his proposed budget, which announced he wanted to cut the Chesapeake Bay Program from $73 million to $0, among other cuts and increases to defense spending.

So there's plenty to read.

"It's much better because I get to read," Reiner said as he ruffles the paper. "And it saves wear and tear on my car."

Reiner and Brown are prime examples of people the Maryland Transit Authority is trying to attract. But the agency is still gauging how users are interacting with the bus system. An MTA official was at the Westfield Annapolis bus stop counting passengers Thursday morning.

MTA officials couldn't give a daily count and also declined to give details on how many riders would need to use the service to keep it active. "Please know that with any new service, MTA looks at a number of factors to keep a line operating, including sufficient ridership," said Sandy Arnette, spokeswoman for the MTA.

For now, riders are enjoying access to the service — especially MTA employees, such as Elaine Furth, who ride for free.

"It's convenient and comfortable," said Furth, who rode the bus Thursday. "I love it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0279038-d71cfbde29381e4e649d6a13da2c7635.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000020071 00000000000 015205  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        0 Pinterest 0 Reddit 0

The Woman of Armageddon is a sci-fi/action crossbreed, taking elements from both action heroine and post-apocalypse genres. Initially created as the basis for a 2012 calendar, now in its third year, the idea has expanded, under the loving care of its creator, Michael Zinn. Zinn took time off from arranging Doomsday, to speak to GWG.org about the end of the world, as he knows it.

For those who don’t know, high concept Women of Armageddon for us.

Women of Armageddon is a (beautiful) vision of an alternate future. “What if the world ended, and only beautiful women were left?”

What’s your background and artistic influences?

Well, I am a computer geek at heart, but when I was in college, everything was lumped into “computer science ” and there was no such thing as Photoshop. I changed my direction, and ended up at the Hartford Art School as a photography major. By the time I left, computers had started doing graphics and I was able to combine my passions.. As far as influences, well, some artists that definitely inspired me are Boris Valejo – as a matter of fact it was his fantasy artwork calendars that directly inspired the look and colors of 2013. I’m also a big H.R. Giger fan. Another big influence is scifi movie posters as wel as “sexploitation” movie posters like Barbarella; two movies that had a specific influence on this project are Planet of the Apes and Mad Max

Where did the idea come from?

Imagine Mad Max meets the Sports Illustrated Swimwear Calendar. The idea originated in 2011, with the prophecies of impending doom in 2012 and the hype of the world ending… possibly on Dec 21, 2012. It was a spoof in my head. A mash up of the Mad Max costumes and women who had the time apparently, to do their makeup and retain their femininity… But it soon evolved to represent women more as a symbol of strength and survival.

Was there a particular type of Armageddon in mind?

Actually, yes and no… The original calendar had a few concepts tossed around. One was that each month would represent a different Armageddon: zombies, aliens, biochemical warfare, natural disaster, nuclear war, etcetera. Another concept was going to be Armageddon around the world, using Landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Empire State building, Wall of China, Golden Gate Bridge. So there’s the “no”. The “yes”, is that in the photographic novel I am developing, there is a specific Armageddon – but that’s not to be disclosed at this time!

How did you go about putting the first calendar together in 2012, getting the models and the weapons?

It was Thanksgiving 2011, and I was visiting family in AZ. The idea had been in my head all year and I finally shared it with my girlfriend at the time, Janine Maloney, who is a fabulously talented makeup artist. She was very encouraging and brainstormed the idea with me, and involved the first models , whom she had worked with on makeup at the local Haunted Houses that usually crop up during Halloween season. They were all very inspired by the concept and eager to get involved, which really helped bring the calendar to life.

In addition to Janine’s “theater” friends, I come from the local music scene, and was able to involve some of my local female musician friends, which helped add some audience to the calendar. We were very fortunate that they were all available and in about three weekends we scrambled to costume and shoot 12 girls! As a matter of fact, a few of the models had boyfriends who built props and sets, and they showed up with some awesome weaponry that appears in the first calendar. It went amazingly smooth for the first time around. I did all the graphic design and layout over a week, and we were able to have the calendar available to order right around Christmas-time!

How was the reaction?

People seemed to really get it for the most part. It also seemed to be inspiring to women. I think people like the fact that these are regular girls and they look great, tough yet battered, Hard, yet soft. Our own reaction – which was interesting – was that this concept needed to expand. We originally were thinking about making a comic book, and in looking for an illustrator, we realized that we had already created a style we could use to express this as a “photo-graphic novel”, a twist on the popular adult version of comic books called “Graphic Novels”

Where did things go from there?

While we were writing the story, the opportunity to appear at ComicCon in NY came up. We didn’t have time to produce the PhotoGraphic Novel we wanted, so we decided to do another Calendar )2013. 2013 was even better than 2012 and we also did a deck of playing cards. The second calendar was amazing! We were definitely better prepared and even more energized – it was also more photography based than post-processed.

What have been the biggest lessons you’ve learned, and the most rewarding moments?

Each project presents its own set of challenge and learning experiences. I learned that a Calendar has a limited window of opportunity for selling! But I also learned that the concept was huge and there was a world to create. The biggest challenge was definitely losing my partner in the project. Janine Maloney is an amazingly creative and talented Makeup Artist who happened to be my girlfriend. When we split up, she moved to New Mexico. The 2014 Calender was emotionally challenging as well as logistically.

Fortunately, a few of the girls i worked with were also talented Makeup Artists and helped me through the challenge, Ally Antun, he only girl that has actually been in all three calendars, is extremely talented and motivated. She has created some great horror characters for “Slim’s Chamber of Horrors” a local haunted house experience that made the news this past season.

The most rewarding moment was holding the first calender in my hands. It was the most tangible proof i had ever seen that “You can do whatever you set your mind to.” The second most rewarding was having a booth at Comicon 2012 in NY with the girls in costume. The response was amazing.

Looks like this is just one of several similar projects – tell us about the others.

Well, This project has definitely connected me to my own style, which I don’t think I had established before, as far as shooting with women goes. While I do enjoy just shooting portraits, The ideas that excite me are more storytelling oriented, a moment in time that speaks to the viewer…

I have a project called DrrtyGrrls which is an homage to old school pinup photography and style, with a little twist – each girl has gotten herself “dirty” in her respective scenario. For example “Arc-Angel” os a girl in a motorcycle shop with a welding flame, working on a motorcycle, or “Flour Girl”- a waitress in a kitchen who has made a bit of a mess with the mixing machine.

Some newer work I’ve been doing is inspired by groups on Facebook like Girls with Guns and Badass Babes, so I have been focusing on the gun culture as well as the biker and tattoo cultures, which are very visual to begin with, providing me with tons of inspiration and material. I have also recently begun working for United Ink, a tattoo based company that runs Tattoo Expos and sponsors their own United Ink Angels – a group of up and coming tattoo models.

What are your favorite action heroine movies?

Hmm. That’s a tough one. I love the Rssident Evil Series. Of course, I have to mention Tarantino’s Kill Bill, and Planet Terror. Can I sneak in Tomb Raider as well?

How would you survive a zombie apocalypse?

Unfortunately, I don’t think I would last too long! But if I had any chance to just escape to the wilderness beforehand, that’s what I’d do. Avoid areas that were once populated.

What next for the Women of Armageddon?

Well, the story is pretty much developed and the script is being put together, so we can begin production on the photo-graphic Novel. But I have also been doing a bit of video production the last few years and it’s a very good possibility that we can bring the Women of Armageddon into some sort of live action series or feature. That would be phenomenal!

The quake's epicentre was 204km (127 miles) northwest of Sibolga on Sumatra's coast, at a depth of nearly 48km, the US Geological Survey said.

Three aftershocks were reported in the northern province of Aceh, but there were no reports of casualties.

Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, one of the world's most active areas for earthquakes and volcanoes.

It has recently been struck by a string of quakes; one off Sumatra in September killed more than 1,000 people.

The latest quake - the largest in the area since March 2008 - struck at 0515 on Wednesday morning (2215 GMT on Tuesday).

Although the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially said a small tsunami would possibly hit coasts within 100km of the quake's epicentre, a destructive widespread tidal wave was said to be unlikely.

Japan's Kyodo news agency reported blackouts in Medan and Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh Province.

Local television reported that people rushed to higher ground in some areas.

Thai authorities also warned people in coastal areas to evacuate to a safe place.

In December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude quake off the coast of Aceh triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed quarter of a million people in 13 countries including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand.

Cross-posted from the website of the journal Juncture http://www.ippr.org/juncture

International interest in universal basic income[1] proposals has increased markedly in recent years.[2] In the UK a basic income has been supported by the Green party and the non-partisan Citizen’s Income Trust. In other countries, such as Finland and France, proposals for basic income pilots and experiments are on the agenda.

The arguments for implementing a basic income are many and varied,[3] yet the proposal remains controversial. And nowhere is this controversy more prominent than among feminists, who have hotly debated the merits of a basic income in terms of its potential contributions to gender equality. Feminist advocates for basic income have pointed to its potential to correct the paid-work bias of contemporary social security systems, and to increase women’s economic autonomy and power within the household by providing a source of unconditional income support that is not tied to paid employment.[4] Critics have argued that basic income will do nothing to directly challenge the gendered division of labour – and may well reinforce it, especially to the extent that unconditional cash benefits increase the incentive for women in particular to reduce their labour market participation, given their relatively weaker attachment to the labour force as a group relative to men, and the central role that this plays in broader inequalities such as income gaps and poverty risks.[5] Accordingly, the feminist debate about basic income has reflected wider feminist disputes about how the state can recognise the unpaid work largely done by women, such as the care of children and the elderly, without reinforcing existing inequalities between men and women.

Recently, many of basic income’s advocates have argued that it promotes gender equality precisely because it is able to skirt this long-running debate. Like Nancy Fraser’s famous ‘universal caregiver’ policy model,[6] a basic income has the potential to satisfy the two core principles of gender equity: anti-marginalisation and anti-androcentrism. This twin potential is the keystone of Fraser’s argument in favour of a universal caregiver model over the caregiver parity or universal breadwinner models. She argued that a caregiver parity model (whereby income supports are directed toward caregivers specifically) would lead to marginalisation, secluding women in the private sphere and perpetuating gender essentialism; on the other hand, the universal breadwinner model (whereby income supports are tied to paid employment) would perpetuate androcentrism by emphasising masculine life-patterns and requiring women to conform to men’s standards in order to be considered equal. Fraser argued that avoiding both of these outcomes requires that we follow what she called the universal caregiver model, under which both men and women are encouraged and supported to participate in the labour market as well as the care and work of the household.

Advocates of basic income have pointed out that it represents a move towards this type of policy model, because its lack of conditionality means that it goes down neither the labourist nor the care path of citizenship.[7] A basic income provides a floor of economic security for everyone, and remains neutral regarding what activities they engage in. In this sense a basic income avoids the drawbacks of a universal breadwinner model that perpetuates androcentric assumptions about the nature of work. But at the same time, a basic income provides a means of valuing the care work that cannot be provided via state or market.

Basic income and intersectionality

A key missing component in the discussion thus far is attention to intersectionality. In recent years, feminist thought has increasingly shifted towards understanding and accounting for the heterogeneity of women’s experiences, and the difficulties of effectively including all types of women in the feminist movement. The role that divides among women play in gender inequality between men and women has emerged as a key debate. Intersectionality, or ‘complex inequality’,[8] means that the experience of any given woman is shaped not only by her gender but by other systems of social stratification such as race and class – and that these dimensions are not simply an additional facet of her identity, but affect her gendered experience as well.

For debates about basic income in particular, intersections between gender and class are especially relevant.[9] Basic income proposals are, in essence, an attempt to provide economic security and raise the welfare floor for the least well-off, without encouraging stigmatisation or further increasing the hardships that they face in terms of complex eligibility and administrative requirements. Thus there is a case to be made that, to the extent that a basic income addresses these particular issues, it does not only reduce or alleviate the suffering associated with poverty and income inequality – it also helps further gender equality goals, particularly when taking heterogeneity among women into consideration as well as differences between women and men.

Crucially, such issues are addressed in Fraser’s underlying framework, even if they are not explicit in shorthand references to the universal caregiver model. In their emphasis on the universal caregiver model, feminists debating the merits of a basic income have downplayed two additional principles of gender equity – anti-poverty and anti-exploitation – that a basic income is best-placed to address, especially when compared to other commonly advocated gender equality measures such as childcare provision or parental leave policies.

Anti-poverty AND anti-exploitation

Fraser lists ‘anti-poverty’ as the very first principle of gender equity. She argues that the prevention of poverty is a key aspect of gender equality, given that women in general are at higher risk of it than men. Indeed, the phrase ‘feminisation of poverty’[10] was coined in recognition of the fact that women tend to be economically disadvantaged in the labour market for a variety of reasons, including responsibilities for children and domestic tasks as well as outright discrimination, which leads to lower market income. This economic risk is then further compounded by many aspects of current social security systems that tie income supports to labour market participation.

While poverty may be ‘feminised’, certain groups of women are clearly more vulnerable to poverty than others. This is particularly true of single mothers, although the level of risk to which they are exposed varies by country. Further, ethnic minority women, disabled women, refugees and migrant women also face a higher degree of economic disadvantage, such that they might be especially likely, relative to more privileged women, to benefit from an income floor. The anti-poverty agenda also recognises gender inequalities as a global or international, rather than intra-national, issue. A high proportion of the world’s poor are women, with those in many developing countries facing a greater array of social, political and economic disadvantages that raise their risk of poverty, as well as related problems such as poor health.

Thus the potential for a basic income to reduce poverty is a crucial component of its potential contribution to decreasing gender inequality. Basic incomes can contribute to poverty reduction in the straightforward sense of securing a certain level of financial welfare via cash transfers. This has been one of the key rationales for piloting basic income proposals in countries in the global south such as Namibia and India, where the anti-poverty effects of cash transfers are most stark given their low standards of living.

Furthermore, the universal aspect of a basic income is likely to increase its effectiveness in terms of preventing, rather than simply alleviating, poverty, because it avoids the unemployment traps of targeted cash transfers. Basic income recipients are free to combine paid employment with receipt of the benefit, and do not risk losing a steady income stream by taking on paid employment or increasing their hours at work. This is especially relevant for single and lower-income women, who are particularly likely to be recipients of targeted cash transfers.

The core role of a basic income in providing economic security and stability also contributes to Fraser’s second principle of gender equity: anti-exploitation. She characterises this as the prevention of the exploitation of vulnerable people, including within the household as well as via the market and the state. Crucially, Fraser argues that anti-exploitation as a principle requires that welfare benefits are not linked to dependency relationships (such as benefits through a husband or an employer). This is a key strength of basic income proposals as opposed to other forms of social security: it has the potential to reduce the power of ‘bosses, boyfriends and bureaucrats’[11] over women’s lives.

With regard to ‘bosses’, a core argument among basic income advocates more generally is that an unconditional source of income will increase the bargaining power of the worker in relation to the employer, as the threat of destitution is removed. This is especially relevant for women given that they tend to be lower paid and in lower authority positions.

With regard to ‘boyfriends’, as an individual-level benefit, basic income helps to redress (or, at the very least, avoids exacerbating) intra-household inequalities between men and women in couple relationships. A core feminist critique of tax-benefit systems has been their use of household rather than individual-level assessments. This system relies on assumptions about the equal sharing and pooling of household income and other resources, which does not always hold in practice – usually to the disadvantage of women and children, who tend to bring lower amounts of independent income into the household. Economic inequalities within the household also underpin and reinforce power differentials between men and women, and between children and adults, more generally. Individual, unconditional payments paid to everyone have the potential to offset some of these inequalities.[12] For women who make less money than their partners, or who would otherwise have no income of their own, a basic income could increase their bargaining power within the household.

A less commonly acknowledged but nevertheless key avenue for exploitative power relationships is the interaction between women and the state. Paternalistic, intrusive and/or coercive interactions between welfare administrators and claimants have become particularly relevant in recent years given the increased use of sanctions in some countries, such as the UK and the US, in order to control the behaviour of those claiming benefits. In contrast to means-tested and/or conditional cash benefits, a basic income’s universal and unconditional nature would remove the need for eligibility enforcement, and so reduce the power and oversight of state officials and caseworkers over benefit claimants’ personal lives – an issue that is especially pertinent for women, who are more likely to be claimants and more likely to be subject to scrutiny of their coupled relationships based on household-level means-testing.

Intersectionality, and a renewed feminist case for basic income

The basic income debate as it currently stands reflects a fundamental feminist disagreement – namely, what to do about the unpaid work of the household: how to value it (and avoid perpetuating androcentric biases) without reinforcing the gendered division of labour and the resultant socioeconomic disadvantaging of women. Nevertheless, the worker-vs-mother dichotomy does not encapsulate the sum total of the female experience, or of gendered disadvantage.

Attention to intersectionality provides an opportunity to widen the feminist debate about basic income beyond care alone, and to better incorporate insights about the diversity of women’s experience. Arguably, this also strengthens the case for a basic income in relation to the goal of gender equality. Not only does it mediate one of the core polarising issues among feminists (whether to prioritise support for labour market participation or care work in the home), but it also addresses issues that are sometimes sidelined within the feminist movement yet which are especially important for the most vulnerable groups of women – issues such as poverty and the exploitation of unequal power relationships between women and their employers, their families and state administrators.

Because of that gap, I’m breathing new life into an old feature that I wrote for the site in FanGraphs’ infancy back in 2008 and 2009.

The series ‘A Minor Review of 2013′ will look back on some of the major happenings in each MLB organization since the beginning of April as a primer for the upcoming FanGraphs Top 10+5 prospects lists. This series will run throughout September and October. I hope you enjoy the series and are eagerly anticipating the start of ‘Prospect List Season.’

The player listed in the sleeper section was featured in a pre-season series that looked at one fringe prospect in each organization that was expected to take a big step forward during 2013, chosen by myself, a scout or a front office talent evaluator.

The Graduate: Nolan Arenado, 3B: Entering 2013, Arenado was known as a strong hitting prospect with solid — but hardly exceptional — defense at the hot corner. Promoted to the Majors after just 18 Triple-A game, he was a well-below-average hitter who played perhaps the best defense at the hot corner in the National League. Early in his career, Arenado was considered a poor defender so the improvements he’s made are nothing short of extraordinary. Once he starts hitting up to his true potential, Arenado could be a perennial all-star.

The Riser: Eddie Butler, RHP: Butler entered pro ball with questions surrounding his ability to stick in the starting rotation due to his lack of reliable secondary offerings. By the end of 2013, though, the right-hander answered all those questions and established himself as one of the better starting pitching prospects in the game. He began the year in Low-A ball but blew through three levels and finished the year with a 0.66 ERA and just 13 hits allowed in six Double-A starts.

The Tumbler: Trevor Story, SS: I ranked Story as the second best prospect in the system behind Arenado at the beginning of the year but they headed in opposite directions once the season kicked off. Concentration appeared to be one of the young shortstop’s biggest issues. He had an OPS of .549 with the bases empty and struck out a whopping 110 times in 281 at-bats (39% of the time) but his OPS was almost .900 with runners on base. There wasn’t a lot to get excited about during Story’s ’13 campaign but he got a little bit better with each passing month and his best performance was in August when he posted an .868 OPS.

The 2013 Draft Pick: Alex Balog, RHP: Balog, 21, entered pro ball with a lot of hype but his first taste of pro ball did not go as well as expected in the small sample of 30 innings. The durable right-hander is a lot more talented than his first-year numbers would suggest so don’t be surprised if Balog is a name you’re hearing a lot about by the end of 2014 — much like the way Eddie Butler took the prospect world by storm in ’13. The California native can dial up his heater into the mid-90s and he shows some promise with his breaking balls.

The Sleeper: Sam Mende, 3B: Mende was a guy that I knew absolutely nothing about when the 2012 season began. I happen to catch him play while I was intending to focus on other prospects, and his defense at the hot corner impressed me. Injuries all but wiped out his 2013 season so he’ll look to make up for lost time in 2014. Unfortunately, he’s in the wrong organization to play third base at the big league level so he may want to learn to diversify his defensive portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279203-e51a270f75bb89d951bd3f3e38f06f20.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004010 00000000000 015111  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        One of the portraits of Caitlin Stasey, posted on her website Herself.com.

Caitlin Stasey has revealed that discovering she was a lesbian while at a Catholic girls school led her to self-harm.

The outspoken actress told Birdee magazine she repressed her sexuality as a teenager because, in her community, being gay was "a condemnable offence".

"It's such a f**king dark and terrible thing to admit, but throughout high school I cut myself - I had a lovely upbringing, but I was mortified by the fact that I had these feelings and that I felt gay, and I was constantly being told it was wrong."

The 24-year-old from Melbourne says the struggle made her to turn her back on religion.

"I became incredibly hateful of religion and am now resolute that it is one of the greatest tragedies to befall mankind."

Stasey also said she would love to run a "totally ethical, all-inclusive strip club for disabled and trans women" as well as an "ethical pornography production company run by women".

"Those are two things I'd love to do," she said.

Earlier this year, Stasey launched her own feminist website Herself.com, which features a series of nude photos and frank interviews about women's relationships with their bodies and sexualities.

She told Daily Life she wanted to "demystify the female form".

"We consider a woman's sexuality so linked to her physicality that for a woman to appear naked publicly is automatically an act of sex and not for herself," she said. "There's also a very specific construct of woman we are all used to seeing, and while those women are no less women, I was so desperate to see different faces, different bodies."

In her own profile on the website she says she is in a loving relationship with a man but identifies predominantly as a lesbian.

"I've known I was mostly gay ever since I can remember," she said. "I know it troubles many people for me to refer to myself as a lesbian considering I have a male partner."

Practical Guide: How to Register Account in Itunes and Submit an App to the App Store

We love when everything is done with few easy steps. And since a lot of our blog readers own their mobile apps we thought it would be a good idea to write down a clear guide on how to register an account in iTunes and submit an app to the AppStore.

Part 1

Account Registration

In order to submit applications to the Store, you will have to have a developer’s account.

NOTE: in order to register as a developer you will have to pay a $99 fee.

Steps for account registration:

Go to Apple Developer Site

Click on “Account” in upper right corner

Create Apple ID or use your existing one

Fill in all the required information in case you are creating a new ID and verify your email address

Success! Now log in.

After you log into your developer account, you will have a lot to read – legal agreement, of course. Spend some time together with your lawyer to really go through all the text because it’s something to do with your business and you don’t want to skip any important points.

As soon as you are done with that and received approval from the lawyer, click on submit and you are ready to go!

Speaking about the fee mentioned above, it is a fee for joining Apple’s Developer Program. Without investing some money, you will not have access to all the info, libraries and tools so this is something that has to be done. These are the necessary steps:

After you log in (as in the steps above), you will see “Join the Apple Developer Program” in the bottom of the page, click on the link

Then click on “Enroll” button on the right side

Now there’ s a tricky part. You can choose whether to enroll as an individual or the company and we’d recommend you choose “individual” option because it will save your time and requires less paperwork. However, if you are a really medium or big-sized company, obviously choose “company” option.

After you check either “individual” or “company”, click on “Start the enrollment”

Select your type of business and click “Continue”

Enter all the required information

Once again read the agreement with your lawyer, receive approval, tick the box “I agree” and click “Continue”

Review all the information once again and click on “Continue”

Now you will be offered an option for automatic renewal of your membership, meaning your apps will always stay available and you will be able to access all membership benefits any time. The option is quite convenient but it’s up to you whether to choose it or not.

After deciding on the automatic renewal option, click “Continue”

Log in again

Fill in the billing information

Click "Purchase"

After all these steps you will receive emails with confirmation about you joining the Developer Program. Now follow the links, log in and voila – you made it!

There is a lot of information in the Developer Center, including all kinds of tutorials, documentation, videos, etc. You will mostly be focusing on Certificates, IDs & Profiles and iTunes Connect while working on your apps.

Part 2

Things to do before app submission

By now you must be familiar with Apple Development Center and you should know the importance of Certificates, IDs & Profiles area. In order for the app to be approved by Apple and run on iOS devices, it has to have a signed Apple Certificate. In case there is no signature or it’s not valid, the app would not run. So in order to make your apps work, you need to go to Certificates, IDs & Profiles and generate profiles. They are generated by Development Center and will allow Xcode to sign your applications. There are two types of profiles:

Development: such profiles are linked to specific devices only so you will use them to check the app on your own device

Distribution: these ones are used for signing your app before submitting it to Apple

And here are the steps on certificate creation:

If you are on Development Center page, click either on Certificates, IDs & Profiles on the left or on the gear icon in the middle of the screen

Once you are there, check that the drop down in the left upper corner says iOS, tvOS, watchOS

Click on “+” in the upper right

You will be directed to “Add iOS Certificate page”. Select “iOS App Development” and click on “continue”

Then you’ll see how to generate CSR by Keychain Access. In order to do so, open the Keychain Access app on your Mac.

After it opens, click on Keychain Access - Certificate Assistant - Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority

A “Certificate Assistant” window will open

In this window, fill in your email and name, tick “save to disk” and “continue”

Save the file on your Mac

You created CSR and now you have to generate this certificate. For that:

Go back to Development Center, click “Continue”

Click on “Choose file”, select the saved file and click “Continue”

You will see a screen, saying that certificate is ready. Download it and then double click on development certificate file in order to install it into the keychain. A Keychain Access dialog will appear, click on “Add” in this window and installation will be completed. After completing all these steps, you got your certificate for development profiles but you also need one for the distribution ones. Here are the things you need to do:

Click on “Add another”

In Production area choose App Store and Ad Hoc, click “Continue”

The process will be similar to the one described above and then you will receive a certificate. After that, download it and double click again for its installation.

Now if you look in Keychain Access you will see your certificates both installed.

After all this tiresome work it’s time to register your device. While being in the Certificates, IDs & Profiles area again, click on Devices – All (in the left side) and then click on “+” on the right. Then:

Open iTunes and plug your device into your Mac

Select your device

When iTunes displays the info about your device, click on the serial number and it will change to UDID of your device, you will need to copy it

Go back to device registration, enter the name for the device and paste the UDID. Click “continue” once you are done

After that, click “Register”

But that’s not all! Now you need an App ID. In the Certificates, IDs & Profiles menu click on Identifiers\App IDs and click on “+” on the right. Fill in all the required info and don’t forget to tick “Explicit App ID”, after that enter the Bundle ID. Then click “Continue – Register” and that’s the time when you can get down to creating distribution and provisioning profiles.

From the same menu as before, click on Provisioning Profiles\All and on “+”

Tick “iOS App Development” and “Continue”

Select an App ID for the profile. You will have only one by now.

Select certificate

Select your device

Enter a descriptive name for this new profile

Download the profile

Click on “Add another”. It will save your time because on this same page it’s possible to create a distribution profile too.

Choose the “App Store” option

Follow the same steps until you download the profile

Now everything is ready for submitting your application!

Part 3

How to run your app on your iOS device

Obviously, you need an app in order to perform all the steps that we are going to describe. However, there are a lot of apps that you can download for free and test in case yours is not ready yet. And here is what you now have to do:

Open the project in Xcode

Open the project navigator

Click on the node of the tree on the left

Click on the target (DropCharge)

Click on “General”

Set Deployment Target (bottom middle) to 9.0

Deployment target means the minimum iOS version that your app will support, simple as that. Keep in mind that if you set your app to iOS 8.0 and the used API would be available on 9.0 only, the app will crash.

The next steps are:

Change bundle identifier (same as for Apple ID)

Assign your team by selecting the necessary account

Click on Build Settings and enter “signing” in search field

In the search results, you will see “Code Signing Identity” section, click on the drop-down for “debug” and “release” entries and choose your provisioning profiles. Select your developer profile for Debug and your distribution profile for Release.

Ensure your device is connected to Mac

Choose to build for this device

Press ⌘B to start building

Press ⌘R

See the app running on the device!

Now let’s see how to actually submit your application to the App Store. First, go to the Member Center of Developer Apple website and use your credentials for login, then click on the iTunes Connect. You will be offered an introduction and you can skip it if you wish so. As well make sure to accept the Terms of Service. And welcome to the dashboard!

In case you want to get money for your app, click on “Agreements, Tax and Banking”, then choose “Request” (upper right) and perform all necessary steps with the help of your lawyer. You will have to fill in contact, bank and tax information. Now let’s move on.

Go back to the dashboard

Click on “My Apps”

Click on “+” in the upper left corner and choose ‘New App”

Fill in the necessary info: choose iOS, fill in the app’s name, select primary language, select correct bundle ID, create SKU. And click on “create”! Then on details screen click on “App information” and fill it. Then go to “Pricing and Currencies” and either choose your price or select that the app would be free. You can also select your pricing schedule there in case you want to go with paid app.

Finally, click “1.0 Prepare for submission”.

Add screenshots and an icon. In case your app is universal, make sure you submit screenshots for both iPhone and iPad.

Complete the description for your app

Enter the keywords and don’t underestimate their importance

Enter URL for website support page

Scroll down to “General App Information” (skipping “Build”)

Add the icon

Set version number

Fill in the info in copyright notice

Next to “rating” you will see “edit section”. Fill it and be honest! The reviewer can change it if they disagree.

Then scroll to “App Review Information”. Here in “Notes” you can write anything you want a reviewer to know about. In other words, you can make reviewer’s job easier by providing all necessary links, credentials, and info that can help faster and better assess your app.

Then you can go to “Version Release” section to choose when you want your app to be released. But if it’s your first submission, just leave the option of automatic release and click “save”. And now click “submit for review”! In case of a message saying there are errors, it may simply mean the app is not uploaded yet so no worries.

However, you also need to submit an app via Xcode. For that:

Go to Xcode and in the upper section choose Generic iOS Device

Then select Product/Archive

Click “Upload to App Store”

Select your credentials, click on “choose”

You will see the app to upload so click “upload”

After you see the successful upload window, click “done”.

Go back to iTunes and go to Build section that you skipped

Click on “Select a build before you submit your app”

Select the build and click “done”

Click “Save – Submit for review – Submit”

Now, wait for your app to be approved! You can check its status in iTunes by clicking on “Activity” in the left.                                                               0279107-f076921364cf4cbed58bfb1eda42a135.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003041 00000000000 015243  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Get the biggest Celtic stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

CELTIC'S Champions League opponents Borussia Monchengladbach have been having fun with their Scottish rival's name ahead of tonight's clash.

A sign outside a Scottish bar went viral ahead of the German outfit's 2-0 victory in Glasgow on Matchday 3 - with the pub seemingly giving up on various attempts to spell "Monchengladbach" and instead opting for "A German Team".

But The Foals took the joke a step further for the return fixture by showing a sign at their Borussia-Park stadium with failed efforts at writing "A Scottish Team".

The tweet, which reads "We tried ...", shows the humorous Germans simply calling their opponents "Celtic".

After changing their Twitter account name to a "A German Team" ahead of the previous fixture, Borussia have now sold 2,000 scarves sporting the branding.

The club say that the scarves were in such high demand that supporters snapped them up within two days.

Thousands of Celtic fans have travelled to Germany for the must-win Champions League game with many enjoying festivities in the old town last night at a pre-match party.

And some are enjoying a drink or two next to the stadium at the Borussia beer garden ahead of the game.

Many supporters who haven't been lucky enough to get one of the 2,500 ticket for tonight's game are expected to watch the match from a fanzone that has been set up in the Bahnhofstraße area of the city.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279216-2cee3d6d6027be6dbd7fb31e9ec88937.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007073 00000000000 015366  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Image caption The US believes Syria could turn to chemical weapons if the situation becomes more desperate

Syria has acted to consolidate its chemical weapons into "one or two" places to prevent rebels capturing them, Russia's foreign minister says.

Sergei Lavrov said the weapons had previously been "scattered" across the country and they were "under control" for the time being.

Mr Lavrov also said President Bashar al-Assad had no plans to leave Syria.

Rebels have been fighting the Assad government for 21 months. Activists say some 44,000 people have been killed.

Meanwhile in Syria on Saturday, activists said a car bomb had exploded in an eastern district of the capital, Damascus, killing at least five people.

'Not going anywhere'

Mr Lavrov told journalists on a flight returning to Moscow from an EU-Russia summit in Brussels: "According to the information we have, as well as the data of the US and European special services, the [Syrian] government is doing everything to secure [its chemical stockpiles].

"The Syrian government has concentrated the stockpiles in one or two centres, unlike the past when they were scattered across the country."

Time may be running out to come up with a credible international plan to secure Syria's chemical weapons for the day President Bashar al-Assad's regime collapses Preparing for a post-Assad Syria

Mr Lavrov said the biggest threat from Syria's chemical weapons would be if militants managed to capture them.

The US fears Syria may be tempted to use the weapons if its situation becomes more desperate.

Mike Rogers, the chairman of the US House Committee on Intelligence, told the BBC a regional plan was needed to secure the weapons "immediately".

"If not, we're going to have a very major destabilising event in the region," Mr Rogers said.

US President Barack Obama warned President Assad this month he would face "consequences" if chemical weapons were turned on the Syrian people, saying it would be "totally unacceptable".

The US has said this would be a "red line" that might trigger military intervention.

Mr Lavrov said he believed Western powers had no appetite to intervene.

"I have the feeling that they are praying for Russia and China to continue blocking permission for external intervention. Because if there is such a decision, they will have to act, and no-one is ready to act."

Mr Lavrov said he believed neither side could win the civil war, and that President Assad was not going to leave.

"Assad is not going anywhere, no matter what anyone says, be it China or Russia," Mr Lavrov said.

He said some regional powers had asked Moscow to mediate for Mr Assad to leave.

Mr Lavrov said he told them: "Why do we have to do it? If you have these plans, go to him yourselves."

Inside Syria, the UK-based opposition activist group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said a car bomb had exploded in the eastern Damascus district of Qaboun, killing at least five people and injuring dozens.

It also reported that rebel forces had warned two predominantly Christian towns they could come under attack.

The rebels said the towns of Mahrada and Sqailbiyeh in Hama province were being used by government forces to launch attacks.

The Observatory also said there were clashes between rebels and government forces in the south of the capital, in the Hajar al-Aswad district.

The Observatory says more than 44,000 people have been killed in the past 21 months of unrest, including nearly 31,000 civilians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279288-0a050c3d4dbd67550c717fb84b2c99b0.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004313 00000000000 015115  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Susan Blackmore, author of the book The Meme Machine, was giving a lecture recently at the Oxford Royale Academy to a group of 17-18-year-olds.

Since she was talking about memes, the subject of religion was inevitable, and that’s where the problems began:

… I pointed out that religions demand lots of resources (I showed them pictures of a church, a Hindu temple, a Jewish menorah and Muslim pilgrims on Hajj); they pose threats to health (I showed people ‘purifying their souls’ by wading in the stinking germ-laden Ganges) and make people do strange things (I showed rows of Muslims bent over with their heads on the floor). I hadn’t gone far with this before five or six young men got up and began to walk out. They had a good distance to go across the large hall, so I said ‘Excuse me, would you mind telling me why you are leaving?’ There was a long silence until one said, ‘You are offending us. We will not listen,’ and they left. Soon after that another bunch left, and then another. I called out to some as they left, ‘Can’t you even listen to ideas you disagree with? In Oxford, of all places, you should be open-minded enough to hear alternative views’. But no. They said I needed an open mind. This really got to me, raising painful memories of my early research on psychics and clairvoyants who said, ‘You just don’t have an open mind,’ when my careful experiments showed no psychic powers. By the time I moved on to showing Internet memes and viral videos more than half the audience was gone.

That’s part of the power of religious memes: They’re so strong that some believers can’t even handle listening to any critiques of it, even objectively sound ones. Mind you, she wasn’t even really criticizing religion, only using it to show how some bad ideas can spread, but it was too much for some True Believers to take.

I don’t see how she could’ve handled the situation any differently. Assuming her tone wasn’t accusatory, and she was speaking about religion the same way she was speaking about cat videos and catch-phrases, the fault here is with those audience members. They were there to learn yet couldn’t handle an idea that actually challenged them.

Algae enjoy symbiotic relationship with embryos.

PUNTA DEL ESTE, URUGUAY

Scientists have stumbled across the first example of a photosynthetic organism living inside a vertebrate's cells. The discovery is a surprise because the adaptive immune systems of vertebrates generally destroy foreign biological material. In this case, however, a symbiotic alga seems to be surviving unchallenged — and might be giving its host a solar-powered metabolic boost.

The embryos of the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) have long been known to enjoy a mutualistic relationship with the single-celled alga Oophila amblystomatis. The salamanders' viridescent eggs are coloured by algae living in the jelly-like material that surrounds the embryo. The embryos produce nitrogen-rich waste that is useful to the algae, which, in turn, supply the developing embryos with extra oxygen. The algae clearly benefit their salamander hosts: Lynda Goff, a molecular marine biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, showed 30 years ago that salamander embryos lacking algae in their surrounding jelly are slower to hatch.

Ryan Kerney of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, has now found that these algae also live inside the embryo's cells. Such a close coexistence with a photosynthetic organism has previously been found only in invertebrates, such as corals. Kerney took long-exposure fluorescent images of pre-hatchling salamander embryos, and saw scattered dots in the unstained tissue — an indicator that it might contain chlorophyll. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed mitochondria in the salamander cells clustering close to the algae. Reporting the discovery on 28 July at the Ninth International Congress of Vertebrate Morphology in Punta del Este, Kerney suggested that the mitochondria might be taking advantage of both oxygen and carbohydrate generated by the alga's photosynthesis.

So when do the algae enter the embryos' cells? A time-lapse video made by Roger Hangarter at Indiana University in Bloomington, and presented by Kerney at the meeting, reveals a fluorescent green flash — an algal bloom — next to each embryo just as its nervous system begins to form. Most research on spotted salamander embryos has focused on earlier periods of development, which might explain why algae have not been seen inside the cells before.

One of Kerney's most curious discoveries suggests that the algae may be a maternal gift. He has found the same algae in the oviducts of adult female spotted salamanders, where the embryo-encompassing jelly sacs first form.

David Wake, an emeritus professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who watched Kerney's presentation, wonders whether algae could be getting into the reproductive cells. This would "really challenge the dogma" that vertebrates' immune systems ban such close relationships, he says. Both Wake and David Buckley, who studies salamander development at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid, agree that the work might tell us more about how vertebrate cells learn to identify intruders.

"It makes me wonder if other species of salamander that have known symbiotic relationships with algae also harbour algae inside their cells," adds Daniel Buchholz, a developmental biologist at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio. "I think that if people start looking we may see many more examples."

USA

Over the course of the past decade, we have come to know Mexico less for its vibrant culture, dynamic people, mouthwatering cuisine, – and more for data and statistics.

When Mexico is invoked in US discourse, it’s typically followed by numerical information that is designed to make you fear our southern border neighbors – the Mexican people.

When Americans think of Mexico today, they think of a drug war that has left an estimated 80,000 Mexicans dead in the last decade. When Americans think of Mexico they also think of the 11 million illegal immigrants who now reside within the United States. Despite only 800,000 having criminal records, President Trump has found roughly 50 million American voters receptive to demonizing illegal Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “drug dealers.

When erroneous racist narratives are weaponized with “lies, damned lies, and statistics,” political cover is provided for the cruel and inhumane victimization of illegal immigrants. It was this political cover that allowed Obama to remove 2.5 million illegal immigrants from 2009 to 2016 – a dubious achievement that barely a raised a liberal voice in opposition.

Trump intends to go further. Much further, aiming to eventually deport every illegal immigrant in the country, whether they came here as minors or not. Trump also intends to build an impenetrable wall along the length of the US-Mexico border at a cost of $40 billion, a bill the American taxpayer will now have to pay.

Mexico

I wanted to go beyond the political rhetoric, raw numbers, and the Trump generated racist tropes, for I’m done with listening to the Other be described in the abstract and Orientalist tones, so I got in my car, and drove 3 hours from my home in Southern California to the Calexico-Mexicali border.

There is no other way to describe Calexico but as a town in the middle of nowhere, unless, of course, you think the middle of the desert is somewhere you’d like to be. Located 125 miles east of San Diego, it’s easy to think you’re already arrived in Mexico given nearly all of Calexico’s 38,000 residents are Hispanic.

In recent times, Calexico has become a staging town for cocaine shipments coming into the United States, with a 64% increase in overall drug seizures in a single year period. Most of this cocaine comes via an elaborate tunnel network. Needless to say Trump’s wall will do nothing to stop this transportation route. So there’s that.

There are 25,000 Calexico-Mexicali border crossings every day. On Friday I was one of them. To pass through into Mexico on foot, as I did, there is no immigration or border control to deal with. You step through a turnstile, and roughly 100 foot steps later you’re in Mexicali, Baja California, home of 400,000 Mexicans.

I had 24 hours to speak to as many of the sprawling city’s inhabitants as possible to see how people living on this side of the border feel about Trump and his proposed wall.

“American Hitler,” is how my first interviewee, the concierge of a luxury hotel, described the 45th President of the United States. I was off to a great start. “Trump has no brain. He wants to add 20 percent tariff to goods made in Mexico to pay for his stupid wall, but everyone knows this will only make our [Mexico made] products more expensive for Americans, and our products less competitive, which will hurt both economies, and if Trump hurts our [Mexico] economy, the more Mexicans will want to cross the border illegally,” he added.

An administrator of a family owned private college in Mexicali told me his compatriots mostly see Trump as an “irrelevant buffoon, another clown in a sea of clowns,” adding that most Mexicans see Trump as a “distraction” or “side show” to bigger issues facing Mexico – including widespread and systemic government level corruption.

The Kid

It was the interview that came next that will stay with me for a very long time, and if you want to put a human face to the human tragedy that is the policy of mass deportation, then let his be it.

Andreas is 23 years of age. He’s a driver for a popular boutique hotel, and speaks fluent English. When I asked how he came to speak the language of my birth better than me, he replied that he was raised in the United States, graduating near top of his class at his high school in Idaho.

“My family moved to the US illegally when I was three years of age. I was deported four years ago [age 19],” he told me. I asked if he had committed a crime, or whether unpaid parking bills led to his deportation, and he replied, “No, I’ve never been in any trouble. What happened is my parents applied for citizenship. They [US government] gave citizenship to my three sisters because they were born in the United States. My parents qualified for citizenship because my sisters were born there.”

So, despite Andreas being brought to the United States without his consent by his parents, who are now US citizens, and despite fact he was just 3-years of age at the time of their migration, and despite fact his entire family now reside lawfully in the US, he was deported to Mexico, a country he hadn’t been to since he was a toddler.

In the event, you’re not quite getting how sinister and barbaric this actually is – Andreas is an American for all intents and purposes, but the Obama administration ripped him from his family, friends, home environment, and dropped him in what is to him a foreign country - without providing aid or assistance. Moreover, at the time of his deportation, Andreas didn’t speak a word of Spanish, outside of basic salutations and numeracy.

When my son chose to return to what effectively is his birth country, Indonesia, at the age 19 I was happy for him, but devastated for me – knowing I would miss him terribly. So I can only imagine how Andreas’ parents feel having their only son torn from them, and his siblings.

While his application for residency is still under review, Andreas still faces an uncertain future. (His final review is in 6 months. I will post an update at that time).

Tragically, Andreas is not an anomaly. He’s the rule rather than the exception. Up to 30,000 immigrants are deported every month – many whose stories echo similarities to his. Collected in the middle of the night, held in processing centers for an indefinite period of time, then dropped inside the Mexico border like discarded refuse – with no family; no personal contacts; no money or resources; and no familiarity with the local language.

A friend, who works in the hospitality industry, and has managed a number of restaurants here in the US, says these stories are all too familiar with anyone who has worked with immigrant service workers. “They’re here one minute, gone the next. And if they do get to fight off the INS, they’re forced to pay exorbitant legal fees.”

A civilized society would seek to put an end to this kind of cruelty and barbarity, but Trump intends to escalate it, apply a blowtorch to it – and with his unconstitutional refugee ban, he moves the United States ever closer to becoming an international pariah state.

The real strangest thing of 2017 is that the White House has chosen to get into the Christmas spirit by making the Presidential residence look like a dark alternate dimension where everything is dying and all hope is lost. I mean, it’s definitely appropriate, but it’s still a bizarre decision.

White House communications director Stephanie Grisham shared this peek at First Lady Melania Trump’s first-ever holiday decorations at the White House, and it’s basically a scene out of a horror film. Gaze at the deadened branches as they cast evil, ominous shadows over the walls, looking as if they’re stretching their fury into a grey, listless sky.

Granted, the hallway looks nicer when it’s fully lit up, although there’s still the problem that the decorations are so boring they make the White House way too white and unpleasant (cough). But the staff can’t leave the lights on all the time—and when they’re off, the nightmare becomes real, turning this spot into one of the scariest hallways in America.

But let’s not dwell on its obvious unpleasantries. I’m not one to look a terrifying gift horse in the mouth! Let’s conjure up some festive comparisons, shall we?

Chris Christie has released a statement on the new revelations today on the burgeoning traffic scandal surrounding his administration.

The full statement:

"What I've seen today for the first time is unacceptable. I am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was I misled by a member of my staff, but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned conduct was made without my knowledge. One thing is clear: this type of behavior is unacceptable and I will not tolerate it because the people of New Jersey deserve better. This behavior is not representative of me or my Administration in any way, and people will be held responsible for their actions."

On Wednesday, new documents of emails and text-message conversations revealed a deeper involvement from Christie's staff than he has claimed. The documents showed that members of his staff were involved in decisions that caused days of traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge — which opponents have charged was done in political retaliation against a Democratic mayor who refused to endorse him for re-election.

Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff, sent an Aug. 13 email to former Port Authority Director of Interstate Capital Projects David Wildstein, a Christie ally: "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."

Overall, the documents show a level of coordination between the Christie administration and the Port Authority over the lane closures, contradicting previous claims that they were part of a "traffic study."

Christie on Wednesday morning abruptly canceled his one scheduled public event of the day, a Hurricane Sandy "housing recovery milestone announcement" in Manahawkin, N.J.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279281-eb455a2282a2ccb98fa8d82c454616ad.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002063 00000000000 015177  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Don't text your ex when your lying in bed with your current beau-thing. That's one of those cardinal rules of relationships that should go without saying, but it seems someone didn't read the user manual before getting into it with London singer Anne-Marie.

That's pretty messed up, but it works out for us, because the vocalist turned all that anger into “Alarm,” a trapped-out pop anthem for pissed off girlfriends everywhere. Of course, when someone hurts you, you've got to hit them twice as hard, so Anne-Marie gave the stems over to Marshmello and he smoked the ooey-gooey bits until they melted into a certified banger.

Felines, generally known as cats, are mammals in the family Felidae of the order Carnivora. Cats are the most carnivorous of all meat-eating animals. The predatory instinct in wild cats can be seen in the domestic cats, for even well-fed domestic cats will hunt mice and birds. Members of the cat family occur naturally in all parts of the world, except Australia and Antarctica.

The cat family includes both big cats (lions, tigers, and leopards) and small cats (lynx, servals, and ocelots). Small cats purr but do not roar, whereas big cats roar but do not purr. The reason for this difference is that the tongue muscles of large cats are attached to a pliable cartilage at the base of the tongue, which allows roaring. In contrast, the tongue muscles of small cats are attached to the hyoid bone, which allows purring, but not roaring.

Most cats have 30 teeth, including large canine and carnassial teeth, and few cheek teeth. This arrangement is well suited to crushing bones and tearing, cutting, and gripping prey. Cats' jaws are limited to vertical movements, and their chewing action is aided by sharp projections on the tongue (papillae) that grip and manipulate food.

Evolution and history

Modern cats first appeared about 25 million years ago. One of the earliest members of the family was the saber-toothed tiger, which lived in Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. This cat had long, upper canine teeth for stabbing its prey. The remains of saber-toothed tigers have been found to be as recent as 13,000 years old.

Cats were first domesticated in ancient Egypt about 5,000 years ago. The Egyptians used cats to protect grain supplies from rodents. They also worshiped cats and mummified large numbers of them along with their owners. Since that time, the domestic cat has spread throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Breeding of cats into specific pedigrees did not begin, however, until the middle of the nineteenth century.

Senses

Cats have excellent binocular (involving the use of both eyes) eyesight, which allows them to judge distances. Cats cannot see in complete darkness, but need at least dim light in order to distinguish objects at night. Cats' eyes have a special reflective layer behind the retina. This layer allows light that has not been absorbed on its first pass through the retina to stimulate the retina a second time, providing good vision in poor light. It is this layer that makes cats' eyes appear to glow in the dark when a light flashes on them.

The senses of smell and taste in cats are closely connected, as they are in all mammals. Distinctive to cats is the absence of response to sweets, and cats avoid foods that taste sweet. The taste buds of cats are located along the front and side edges of their tongues. Their vomeronasal organ, also known as Jacobson's organ, is a saclike structure located in the roof of the mouth. This organ is believed to be involved in sensing chemical messages associated with sexual activity. When a male cat smells a female's urine, he may wrinkle his nose and curl back his upper lip in a gesture known as flehmening. He also will raise his head and bare his teeth.

Cats have the ability to hear high-frequency sounds that humans are unable to hear. This ability is particularly helpful when cats are stalking prey such as mice, since the cats can detect the high-frequency sounds emitted by these rodents. The external ears of cats are flexible and can turn as much as 180 degrees to locate sounds precisely.

A cat's whiskers have a sensory function, helping it avoid objects in its path in the dimmest light. If a cat passes an object that touches its whiskers, it will blink, thus protecting its eyes from possible injury. Besides the long cheek whiskers, cats have thicker whiskers above their eyes. Cats use their nose to determine the temperature, as well as the smell, of food. The hairless paw pads of cats are an important source of tactile (touch) information gained from investigating objects with their paws.

Behavior

In the wild, most forest-living members of the cat family tend to be solitary hunters. Some species of cats live in pairs, while others, such as lions, live in family groups. Cats engage in daily grooming, which not only keeps their fur in good condition, but also helps them regulate their body temperature and keeps their coat waterproof.

Cats need a great deal of sleep, which is consistent with the large amounts of energy they expend during their hunting periods. They sleep onand-off almost two-thirds of the day. Because of a slight fall in their body temperatures when they sleep, they look for warm, sunny spots for dozing.

Words to Know

Digitigrade posture: A manner of walking on the toes, as cats and dogs do, as opposed to walking on the ball of the feet, as humans do.

Flehmening: A gesture of cats that involves curling the lips upwards, baring the teeth, wrinkling the nose, and raising the head.

Righting reflex: The ability of a cat to land on all fours after a fall.

Vomeronasal organ: A pouchlike structure on the roof of a cat's mouth whose purpose is probably related to sexual behavior in cats.

Cats are excellent climbers, great jumpers, and have remarkable balance. Except for the cheetah, cats have retractable claws that are curved, sharp, and sheathed. The claws are particularly useful to cats when climbing trees. The bones of their feet (like those of dogs) are arranged in a digitigrade posture, meaning that only their toes make contact with the ground, which increases their speed of running. Cats have the remarkable ability—called the righting reflex—to right themselves during a fall. The righting reflex causes first a cat's head, then the rest of its body, to turn toward the ground as it falls. Thus, the cat lands on all four feet.

Cats follow a well-defined hunting sequence that begins with the sighting or smelling of prey. The hunting skills that cats display are in some aspects instinctual and in others learned. Cats begin learning how to hunt through the play they engage in when they are young. Mother cats are involved in teaching hunting skills to their young, first by bringing back dead prey, later by bringing back immobilized (injured) prey, allowing young cats to kill the prey themselves. Still later, the mother cat will take the young cat on a stalking and killing mission so that it learns how to successfully hunt. Cats that do not have the opportunity to learn to hunt from their mothers do not become good hunters.

Cats are territorial, marking their territory by spraying the boundaries with urine. Cats also scratch and rub against fixed objects to mark their territory. Within a male territorial boundary, there may be several female territories. During mating, the male seeks out or is lured to nearby females that are ready to breed. Females may vocalize loudly when they are ready to mate, thus attracting males. Frequent scenting and rubbing against trees also help the male cat know the female is ready to mate. In cats, frequent sexual contact is important to insure successful ovulation (production of egg cells), which is brought on during sexual intercourse.

The gestation (pregnancy) period in cats depends upon their body size. Domestic cats have a gestation period of about 60 days, and an average litter size of about four kittens. In the wild, gestation ranges from slightly less than 60 days for the smaller species of cats to about 115 days for large cats, such as lions. The number in the litter varies from one to seven; the body size of the cat does not seem to be the factor that determines litter size. It may have more to do with the availability of food and the survival rate in the area the cat inhabits. With the exception of lions, the care and training of the young are left to the mother. Nursing continues until the cubs or kittens are gradually weaned and learn to eat meat.

Species of big cats

There are eight species of big cats, including the lion, tiger, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, snow leopard, clouded leopard, and cougar. The onza is a possible undescribed species or subspecies from Mexico that resembles the cougar and has been seen only rarely. Sightings of the onza go back to the time of the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521. The first specimen of this cat was collected only in 1986 by a Mexican rancher, who shot what he thought was a puma (mountain lion).

The lion. Lions were once distributed over much of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Today, lions are found only in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Gir Forest, a wildlife sanctuary in India. Lions prefer open grasslands to forest, but also are found in the Kalahari Desert. Adult male lions weigh between 300 and 500 pounds (135 and 225 kilograms), while the female weighs about 300 pounds (135 kilograms). Lions are a light tawny color with black markings on the abdomen, legs, ears, and mane. Lions live up to 15 years, reaching sexual maturity in their third year. Male lions have been observed to kill cubs that they have not fathered.

Lions are the most social of the cats, living in family groups called prides, consisting of four to twelve related adult females, their young, and one to six adult males. The size of the pride usually reflects the amount of available food. Where prey is abundant, lion prides tend to be larger, making them better able to protect their kills from hyenas and other scavengers. Most lion kills are made by the females. Males defend the pride's territory, which may range from 8 square miles (20 square kilometers) to more than 150 square miles (400 square kilometers).

The tiger. The tiger is the largest member of the cat family, with males weighing from 400 to 600 pounds (180 to 275 kilograms) and females from 300 to 350 pounds (135 to 160 kilograms). Tigers range from a pale yellow to a reddish-orange color (depending on habitat), with characteristic vertical stripes. Tigers live in habitats with a dense vegetation cover, commonly forests and swamps in India, Southeast Asia, China, and Indonesia. A century ago, tigers inhabited areas as far north as Siberia, all of India and Southeast Asia, and regions along the eastern part of China. Today, all eight subspecies of tigers are endangered.

The tiger lives a solitary life and systematically protects its territory by marking its boundaries with urine, feces, glandular secretions, and scrape marks on trees. Tigers are solitary nocturnal (night-time) hunters, approaching their prey stealthily in a semicrouching position. When close enough, the tiger makes a sudden rush for the prey, attacking from the side or the rear. The prey is seized by the shoulder or neck with the tiger's front paws and jaws, while keeping its hind feet on the ground. The tiger applies a throat bite that usually suffocates its victim, which it carries into cover and consumes.

The leopard. Male leopards weigh about 200 pounds (90 kilograms), with females weighing about half that amount. Leopards are found in sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Some small populations of leopards are still found in Arabia and North Africa. Leopards have a distinctive coloring, black spots over a pale brown coat. Their habitats include rain forests, dry savanna grasslands, and cold mountainous areas.

Leopards feed on a variety of small prey, usually hunting at night by ambush. Leopards use trees as resting places and frequently drag their catches up into trees to eat them. The number of leopards is declining worldwide due to hunting and habitat destruction from human population pressures.

The cheetah. Cheetahs are the fastest animals on land, reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour (110 kilometers per hour). Over short distances, a cheetah can outrun any other animal. Cheetahs resemble leopards in that they have a black-spotted pattern over a tawny coat, but are distinguished by large black "tear" stripes under their eyes, a long, lithe body, and a relatively small head. Cheetahs are the only members of the cat family that do not have retractable claws. Cheetahs are solitary hunters, feeding on gazelles and impalas. They hunt mainly in the morning and early afternoon, when other large cats are usually sleeping, thereby enabling them to share hunting areas with other carnivores. Cheetahs are found in north and east Africa and along the eastern regions of southern Africa, as well as in selected areas of the Middle East and southern Asia. There is

a considerable trade in cheetah skins, and hunting, together with the loss of habitat, threatens their survival in the wild.

Other big cats. Among other large cats are the jaguar, the snow leopard, and the clouded leopard. These three cats inhabit a forest wilderness, and all are solitary and nocturnal. Jaguars are found in Central and South America, while the snow leopard is found in Central Asia, and the clouded leopard in Southeast Asia. The average weight of the jaguar is about 125 pounds (55 kilograms). The snow leopard is found in the Himalayas at elevations from 9,000 feet (2,750 meters) to nearly 20,000 feet (6,000 meters). The clouded leopard and the snow leopard have a rigid hyoid bone in their throats which prevents them from roaring. The black panther is a black form of the jaguar. Its spots are visible within its black coat. The cougar, also known as the puma or mountain lion, is about the size of a leopard and ranges from western Canada to Argentina. The cougar is found in mountains, plains, deserts, and forests, and preys on deer and other medium-sized herbivores (plant eaters).

The small wild cats

The small wild cats, such as the lynx and the bobcat, are considered to be the ancestors of the domestic cat. They are native to most areas of

the world, except Australia and Antarctica. Other features small wild cats share with domestic cats include the inability to roar, retractable claws, and a hairless strip along the front of their noses. Small wild cats include the European wild cat; the African wild cat; the sand cat, of the Sahara; the African tiger cat, of tropical forests; the golden cat; and Pallas' cat, of central Asia.

Asian medium-sized cats include the African serval and the caracal or desert lynx of the Sahara. Medium-sized cats of the Americas include the ocelot of South and Central America and the jaguarundi.

The wildcat or bobcat of North America is colored to blend in with the rocky, densely vegetated background of its habitat. Bobcats rely more on hearing than on sight to catch their prey, and the tufts on their ears are thought to improve their hearing. The lynx lives in cold climates and has long legs, to make trekking through deep snow easier, and foot pads covered with fur, to protect them while walking in snow. The Canada lynx differs from the common lynx in that it is larger, has longer hair, and does not have a spotted coat.

The other 26 species of small wild cats live mainly in forests and feed on small prey, such as rodents, hares, lizards, small deer, fish, snakes, squirrels, insects, and birds. Most species have a spotted or striped coat and usually have a rounded head. Small wild cats are either solitary or form groups, depending on the abundance of the food supply. Some species, such as the ocelot, are hunted for their spotted skin and are in danger of becoming extinct.

Domestic cats

The breeding of domestic cats involves basic principles of heredity, with consideration of dominant and recessive (suppressed) traits. It was in England that cat breeding first became serious enough that so-called "purebred" cats were displayed at cat shows. In England a system of authenticating a cat's genetic lineage was also begun by issuing a pedigree certificate. Special associations were established to regulate the cat pedigrees and to sponsor the cat shows.

Cat breeds can be categorized as either long-haired breeds or short-haired breeds. Within each group, head and ear shape and size, body formation, hair color and length, eye color and shape, and special markings like stripes and color variations on the feet, tail, face, and neck distinguish the breeds from one another.

More than 100 different breeds of cats are recognized around the world, subdivided into five broad groups. One group includes Persian longhairs; another, the rest of the long-haired cats; a third, the British short-haired cats; a fourth, the American short-haired cats; and a fifth, the Oriental short-haired cats.

The Persian cat, highly prized among cat fanciers, has a round body, face, eyes, and head with a short nose and legs. Its fur is long and woolly, and its tail is fluffy and bushy. Persians vary from black to white, cream, blue, red, blue-cream, cameo, tortoiseshell, smoke, silver, tabby, calico, pewter, chocolate, and lilac. Other popular long-haired cats include the Balinese, the ragdoll, the Turkish angora, and the Maine coon cat. Among the short-haired cats, the Manx, British shorthair, American short-hair, Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese are popular. One breed is hairless: the sphynx, bred from a mutant kitten in 1966, does not even have whiskers.

The domestic cat is rivaled only by the dog as a household pet, and in recent years has outnumbered the dog as an urban pet. Cats are more self-sufficient than dogs in that they self-groom, need little if any training to use the litter box, and don't have to be walked. Cats are generally quiet and aloof, but will display affection to their owners. They have the reputation of being fussy eaters, but will usually adapt quickly to a particular brand of cat food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279358-454334759b124a4cfdb1f68afa65ab1b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006273 00000000000 015203  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Left to its own defenses, a farm field growing a variety of plants tends to attract fewer insect pests than a field growing just one type of crop. While scientists and farmers have noted that difference for years, the reasons behind it have been poorly understood.

A study led by the University of California, Davis, and published Oct. 12 in the journal Nature explains that much of the discrepancy may have to do with the nutritional needs of insects. Returning plant diversity to farmland could be a key step toward sustainable pest control.

“Insects have a perfect nutrient level that they really like,” said lead author William Wetzel, a doctoral student in Population Biology at UC Davis at the time of the study and currently an assistant professor at Michigan State University. “When it’s too high or too low, they do poorly.”

The problem with monocultures

The problem with monocultures, Wetzel said, is if an insect likes the crop, that insect has a large food supply to draw from all in one place. Conversely, a field containing a variety of plants does not offer a large block of food for the insect, so it will not get the nutrients it needs to survive and thrive.

“A monoculture is like a buffet for plant-eating insects where every dish is delicious,” Wetzel said. “A variable crop is like a buffet where every other dish is nasty.”

Many small farms around the world already include a diverse mixture of plants. But in most monocultures, the plants are bred to be as identical as possible. How can larger growers introduce more diversity while maintaining their same level of production?

Mixing it up

One way, the study suggests, is to introduce a mixture of genotypes of the same crop species with different nutrient levels. For example, the parts consumers eat, such as the ear of corn or head of broccoli, could be identical; but the parts insects eat, like the leaves, could vary. This would allow for consistency in what is sent to market while introducing diversity to the crop.

Wetzel said this sort of genotype mixing for plants is already being done on some rice and wheat fields to reduce the spread of disease among the crops.

“So far people haven’t done that in ways to reduce insects,” Wetzel said. “But it shows that it’s possible to mix varieties and genotypes together. Now we need to think about how to do that to control insects.”

Background

For the study, researchers examined 53 species of insects — mostly caterpillars, as well as grasshoppers, beetles, aphids and flies. They applied a universal mathematical law called Jensen’s inequality to the data collected to calculate how plant diversity influences plant-eating insects.

Co-authors on the study include Heather Kharouba from UC Davis Center for Population Biology and University of Ottawa Department of Biology, Moria Robinson from UC Davis Center for Population Biology, Marcel Holyoak from UC Davis Department of Environmental Science and Policy, and Richard Karban from UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology.

The study was supported by grants from the UC Davis Center for Population Biology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279335-20bb411fa0cf3bdb7545d96ef35b6db7.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004520 00000000000 015327  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Washington (CNN) Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and his allies are preparing primary challenges against Republican senators, a source close to Bannon confirmed to CNN.

The target list includes Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, Alabama Sen. Luther Strange, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, the source said.

Flake, a strong critic of Trump, has not backed down from the President in the wake of Trump's public attacks against him.

The news comes as Bannon claimed "the Republican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election" in an interview that aired on "60 Minutes" Sunday night

When asked by CBS' Charlie Rose who in the GOP establishment opposed Trump's agenda, Bannon named Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan specifically.

"They do not want Donald Trump's populist, economic nationalist agenda to be implemented," Bannon said. "It's very obvious."

Asked about attacking the very people Trump needs to enact his policy proposals, Bannon said GOP leaders won't provide such help "unless they're put on notice."

"They're going to be held accountable if they do not support the President of the United States," he said. "Right now there's no accountability. ... They do not support the President's program. It's an open secret on Capitol Hill. Everybody in this city knows it."

Bannon has held private meetings with possible challengers whom he plans to support in the primaries, Politico reported. He has begun working with conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer and has installed an ally in an outside group that is expected to target GOP lawmakers and push Trump's agenda, the article said.

Bannon was ousted in mid-August amid a reshuffling of power within the White House, just a few weeks after retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly took over as chief of staff with a goal of instilling order in a chaotic operation beset by internal divisions, staff infighting and a storm of controversies.

Bannon has since returned to his role as executive chairman at the conservative online publication Breitbart News, a job he held before joining Trump's campaign.

Bannon is currently in China, where he will deliver a keynote address Tuesday on the subject of "American economic nationalism, the populist revolt and Asia" at an event organized by Hong Kong brokerage firm CLSA.                                                                                                                                                                                0279263-282a38de6bdf9cdb7b04775799a49be5.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004406 00000000000 015233  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Rick Bowmer/AP

Prosecutors rested their case Tuesday in the trial of seven occupiers of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, turning it over to the defense who will begin laying out its case Wednesday.

The prosecution began the day with a gun show, presenting to the jury 22 long guns and 12 handguns found on the refuge along with copious amounts of ammunition.

The firepower display was part of the prosecution’s attempt to prove the defendants prevented federal employees from doing their jobs through the use of force, intimidation or threats. Since the start of the trial, government lawyers have shown jurors photos and videos of weapons at the refuge during the occupation.

FBI agents testified the guns were recovered from the West Encampment, an area on the far edge of the refuge headquarters also known among occupiers as “Camp Finicum.” They identified each gun as it was shown to the jury, noting where it was found and whether it was loaded.

Among the guns presented was a weapon registered to Ammon Bundy, recovered from the front seat of occupier David Fry’s car, according to testimony. Fry was the final occupant to surrender to authorities in February.

Defendant Kenneth Medenbach’s attorney, Matt Schindler, objected to the prosecution’s attempt to present ammunition as evidence. He argued everyone in the courtroom could agree ammunition was at the refuge without testimony. Judge Anna Brown overruled the objection, allowing the prosecution to continue.

FBI agent Ronnie Walker testified the bureau recovered more than 18,000 rounds of ammunition at the refuge. That included more than 1,000 spent shell casings recovered from the boat ramp at the refuge. The jury saw a video Monday of what the government argued was Ryan Payne conducting a training clinic of sorts with several men firing weapons. Payne already pleaded guilty in Oregon and still faces charges in Nevada for a standoff with federal agents there in 2014.

Prosecutors have argued throughout their case the Oregon occupation was not a peaceful protest. With Tuesday’s presentation, the government seemed to hope the volume of weapons and ammunition, as well as the types of guns recovered, would illustrate that to the jury.

The defense will begin Wednesday morning with testimony from FBI agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0279334-54c823bf009d5fe9ee78f7a7ee4ebdf6.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005322 00000000000 015452  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        SHANGHAI, China, Apr 20, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --

THE MORNING PLUM:

Donald Trump’s slide in the national polls is becoming so obvious that even he may not be able to deny it for much longer. Or will he?

Politico’s Steven Shepard has a good analysis of all the recent polling that makes two basic points. First, the polls now “unanimously” show that Hillary Clinton is building a real lead over Trump. And second, a look at all the recent polls showing him upside down — which are detailed at length in the piece — reveals that Trump’s personal unfavorable numbers are not just bad. They are actually “setting modern records for political toxicity.”

But there are two additional key points. First, note the intensity of dislike of Trump:

It’s not just the overall unfavorable numbers — it’s the intensity of the antipathy toward Trump, and the lack of enthusiasm for him. In the ABC News/Washington Post poll, 56 percent of respondents had a “strongly unfavorable” opinion of Trump, compared to just 15 percent who had a “strongly favorable” opinion. In the Bloomberg poll, 51 percent had a “very unfavorable” opinion of Trump, with only 11 percent having a “very favorable” opinion.

And the second key point is that, while Hillary Clinton is also disliked, there is just no comparison to Trump:

Clinton’s image ratings are also “upside-down” — but compared with Trump, she’s more than likable enough. The ABC News/Washington Post poll pegs her favorable rating at 43 percent (25 percent strongly favorable), with 55 percent viewing her unfavorably (39 percent strongly unfavorable).

Crucially, note that in the WaPo and Bloomberg polls, a majority of Americans has a strongly unfavorable view of Trump. But the WaPo poll shows only a minority of 39 percent has a strongly unfavorable view of Clinton. That’s true of the Bloomberg poll, too, in which 40 percent view her very unfavorably.

Speaking at a rally in Dallas, Tex., Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said that the LGBT community "is starting to like Donald Trump." The remarks come after a shooting a Orlando nightclub that killed 49 people. (Reuters)

This is another way in which there is simply no equivalence in how disliked Trump and Clinton are, which cuts against one of the punditry’s cherished narratives, i.e., that gosh, it’s just so awful that the parties are foisting two deeply hated candidates on the poor voters!

One is strongly disliked by a majority of Americans (at least in those two polls), and the other isn’t. That’s a key distinction: It suggests that Trump could be inspiring a level of mainstream antipathy and even revulsion that could prove harder to turn around than the less intense dislike Clinton is eliciting.

Yet all indications are that Trump is still so caught up in the glow of his GOP primary victories that he may not even be capable of acknowledging what’s happening right now. In a key tell, Morning Joe aired some footage of Trump at a rally in Dallas last night, in which he launched a lengthy soliloquy about how the polls had underestimated his strength in the primaries. At one point, he said this about those polls:

“When I run, I do much better. In other words, people say, ‘I’m not gonna say who I’m voting for’ — don’t be embarrassed — ‘I’m not gonna say who I’m voting for,’ and then they get in, and I do much better. It’s like an amazing effect.”

It would not be surprising if Trump is telling himself something similar about the general election polling, if, that is, he even takes it seriously enough to bother thinking about it at all.

**************************************************************

* BERNIE TAKES STEPS TOWARDS ENDING CAMPAIGN: John Wagner reports that Bernie Sanders spoke to his supporters via livestream last night, and while he did not endorse Hillary Clinton, he indicated the end is near:

“The major political task that together we face in the next five months is to make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly,” Sanders said of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. “And I personally intend to begin my role in that process in a very short period of time.” But “defeating Trump cannot be our only goal,” Sanders cautioned.

Meanwhile, Sanders aides confirm he is not trying to flip super-delegates, meaning that his only remaining goal is to try to secure as many concessions as possible heading into the convention.

* MEDIA MOVES ON FROM COVERING BERNIE: Yamiche Alcindor adds this biting detail about last night’s speech:

As Mr. Sanders spoke of continuing his political revolution, much of the mainstream media that he regularly bemoans had moved on. CNN dedicated its coverage to the Orlando massacre, while Fox News hosts discussed the scourge of terrorism. MSNBC aired the beginning of his remarks live and then cut away. But Mr. Sanders’s core supporters, who have given his cause voice on Twitter for more than a year, were still there for him. The hashtag #OurRevolution became the fourth-most popular in the United States as he spoke.

The end of campaigns is often a wrenching experience for those who poured their souls into it for months and months.

* IS BERNIE LOSING HIS LEVERAGE? Politico’s Gabriel Debenetti suggests that Sanders may actually be losing his leverage over the convention, as his top supporters begin to announce that they are backing Clinton:

It’s the one thing he’s been bleeding every day ever since he dropped California’s primary by a much wider-than-expected margin last week. Sanders’ summer was supposed to be all about building leverage for the Democratic convention, providing him with a better hand to play as he presses Clinton to accept his policy positions and party reform suggestions. Now, the people closest to him aren’t sure how exactly to get it back.

One idea: Endorse Clinton, throw the Sanders movement’s energy into defeating Trump, and reconstitute it as a vehicle to pressure Clinton from the left, should she win.

* FIGHT OVER FRACKING LOOMS FOR DEMS: The Hill previews an interesting battle taking shape among Democrats: Environmentalists who back Sanders want Dems to put anti-fracking language into the platform. Sanders has called for a national backing on fracking, while Clinton has called for regulating it and supports ending it where local officials do.

However this is resolved, environmental advocates will likely coalesce behind Clinton, since she supports implementing the global climate deal, while Trump would nix it immediately.

* REPUBLICANS WON’T ACT ON GUNS, AGAIN: The Post reports that the Dem push for new gun measures in the wake of the Orlando shooting is likely to run into the same old brick wall of opposition to action from Republicans. But:

Republicans have offered bills that would keep guns away from terrorism suspects, but only if authorities can prove probable cause within three business days of the attempted sale….Sen. Charles E. Schumer dismissed the GOP proposals as “a way for them to say they’re doing something when they are doing nothing.”

There are serious reasons for skepticism about the Dem proposal on terror suspects. But Republicans won’t act on expanding background checks to cover private sales, either, even as they pretend to be open to some kind of action.

* CAN HILLARY BROADEN THE MAP AGAINST TRUMP? National Journal asks a very good question: Should Clinton be seriously competing in Arizona and Georgia? Note this nugget:

Cred­ible pub­lic polling in Ari­zona has been sparse. But one private poll con­duc­ted by an in­terest group un­af­fili­ated with either cam­paign and provided to Na­tion­al Journ­al found Trump lead­ing Clin­ton 42 per­cent to 39 per­cent in the state.

Three points — in Arizona! If true, that would be consistent with the Clinton campaign’s view that Trump puts states such as these in play. Also watch North Carolina.

* AND HOW FAR WOULD TRUMP GO? Michael Gerson suggests some good questions for Trump:

What limiting principle would prevent a roundup of all Muslims?…What is the limiting principle that would prevent his use of nuclear weapons against the Islamic State capital of Raqqa?…What limiting principle would prevent President Trump from targeting congressional opponents with innuendo that they are traitors or murderers, or any other accusation that Alex Jones puts on the Web?….What limiting principle would prevent him from changing libel laws to restrict media criticism against him?

As I’ve argued, people who interview Trump should press him for as many specifics on his intentions as possible. In the event of a major terror attack or threat, would he rule out internment camps for Muslims? What about rooting them out of government?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279261-739fc4c1959724aff21b1eaeb3003be5.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005757 00000000000 015205  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        (KUTV) One Utah woman is making a name for herself with an unusual product.

Thumbing through a rack of dresses, Rosemary Card points out some of her favorites. "These are a bunch of samples. This is the Marilyn dress."

She never dreamed that one day she would actually be designing, of all things, LDS temple dresses.

Her path to starting a temple dress line, called Q.Noor, involves prayer.

"I was praying and I was at the temple," Card said.

But it also involves the entertainment world. "It's kind of a funny story," she said.

It was the summer of 2005, the High School Musical movie was being filmed at East High in Salt Lake and Card decided to try out.

"They said they needed dancing extras, so we immediately signed up," she said.

After that, Card started a modeling career in New York City at just 16 years old.

"That was nothing that my parents had ever raised me to desire to do," said Card. "It was really crazy."

But after two years in New York, a job in Tokyo tested her beliefs and it had to do with shedding her clothes.

"When I was under 18 I could say 'Oh, I have to keep my clothes on, I'm 16' and you can't really push past that, but once I was a legal adult it was a different story," she explained. "It wasn't for me."

She eventually ended up inside the temple praying for inspiration about what to do next.

As she looked around at the young women in the room, the thought came to her about designing temple dresses for women her age.

"Not that they needed to be fashionable or anything like that--something that a young woman, an 18 year-old would fill comfortable in and would feel like it's a familiar designer style," said Card.

Her experience in the fashion industry did not go to waste.

"I was able to work with people that were the top of the craft in the world," she said. "I worked with the top make-up artist, the top designers, the top photographers, top stylist."

With no business experience, she went to work, sketching and designing samples, working with seamstresses and meeting with a clothing manufacturer in Los Angeles.

But the early work didn't come without a learning curve.

"I thought I bought all white, but in fact I bought like a pink- white and a cream and an off- white," Card said, spreading out some rolls of fabric she got on her first trip to L.A.

Card doesn't expect to become a household name.

"I don't see my whole life focus being making temple dresses," she said.

But she says she's in it to inspire young women.

"My hope is that women in Q Noor dresses can put on their dress, love it and then focus on what actually matters when they're in the temple," said Card. "There's much bigger things than what you are wearing."

Right now her dresses are actually in pre-production.

She's got a lot of orders but is in the process of manufacturing. The company has only been a reality for about a year.

If you're wondering about the name of the company, she says the "Q" stands for queen and "noor" is the Arabic word for light.

Card sells her designs on the Q.Noor website.

You can still read through it, but the code examples won’t work as is, and will need various changes. Up to date documentation for the betanet is available here. You can change the address to access docs for other branches like zeronet.

A word about different testnets: there is usually a zeronet running, which follows new developments closely and an alphanet which is more stable. The real network is currently called betanet (transactions persist to the main network). The alphanet is currently obsolete.





Introduction

In this article we will look at writing a simple oracle to help us interact with off-chain systems. If you haven’t read them yet, start with the previous articles. No blockchain expertise is required, although general programming knowledge would be useful.





The idea

We would like to utilize some information in our contracts, but it’s only available outside the blockchain. To make it easier to use such information, we can use an oracle. Oracles are essentially bridges between the blockchain and anything outside of it, the downside being that we have to trust their honesty or ensure that they are honest somehow (e.g. by paying them enough that it isn’t profitable to bamboozle us).

For our example, we will build an oracle that publishes the BTC/USD exchange rate every hour. You can use any exchange with a suitable API, but I will use Bitstamp. The oracle will consist of a server and a contract. The server queries the API of the exchange, processes the received data if necessary, and calls the contract to update its data. Other contracts (users) call the oracle contract to get the latest exchange rate.





The contract

Let’s start by preparing the contract. We can adapt the data publisher pattern, which can be seen e.g. in this example by Milo. The input is an option type, with requests for data containing an empty option and requests to update the data containing the new data, a key to prove authenticity and a counter value to prevent replay attacks.

An option type is an abstraction by which we let the compiler know that a value may or may not be present.

option nat

This can either be an empty value None or a natural number nat . When we encounter it in a contract, we can use the IF_NONE instruction to inspect it – in case it contains a None , the first branch is executed, otherwise the second one is. To construct the option type, we can use NONE or SOME with some value that we want wrap.

We could also use a boolean to decide what to do, but using the option is cleaner.

The exchange rate is a positive decimal number, with 2 digit precision (at least in case of the Bitstamp API). Since there is no float type in Michelson, we will need to multiply the actual exchange rate by a hundred to get a whole number and then use the nat type for natural numbers. There’s also an int type, but since we know the value will never be zero nor negative, we don’t need it.

To prove that a request to update the data is coming from the oracle server, we will sign the data with a public key, and keep the associated private key secret. If you haven’t seen this before, you can read up on public key cryptography on Wikipedia. For now, you only need to know that we can sign data with our private key, and then our public key can be used to check that we really did. If someone else tries to sign data with a different key, checking with our public key will fail. We can publish our public key as a part of a contract, while keeping our private key a secret.

We can use the alphanet node to handle the signing for us:

./alphanet.sh hash and sign data `(Pair 730115 1)` for my_identity

Note that we are actually signing the pair of exchange rate and the counter here, rather than the exchange rate alone. This means that a transaction can’t be reused, without recalculating the hash and the signature. The hash depends only on the data, and will be the same even for different accounts (with different private keys). The main reason for using it is to get an input of uniform length for the signing procedure.

The input parameters of the contract will be the option, containing the data and their signature. When retrieving data, the contract will return the exchange rate (a natural number), otherwise it will return 1. The storage will contain the most recent exchange rate, the counter to prevent replay attacks and the public key to check new data against. The whole header will look like this:

parameter (option (pair signature (pair nat nat))); # ^ ^ # | | # data counter storage (pair (pair key nat) nat); # ^ ^ ^ # | | \ # key counter \ # data return nat;

First, let’s write the part that handles data retrieval:

code {DUP; CAR; IF_NONE{CDR;DUP;CDR;PAIR} # data retrieval branch {/*more code*/} # data update branch }

We simply access the storage, and take out the data, then return it. We use PAIR since we need to pair the return value with storage, which remains unchanged.

On to the tricky part. Let’s check whether the counter in the input matches the counter in storage:

code {DUP; CAR; IF_NONE{CDR;DUP;CDR;PAIR} # data retrieval branch {DUP; # data update branch DIP{CDDR; DIP{CDR; # access the counters DUP; CAR; CDR}; CMPEQ; # check if counters are equal IF{}{FAIL};}; # fail if not # more code... }

If the counters match, we should check for authenticity of the data. The H instruction takes a piece of data and produces a hash for us:

:: 'a : 'S -> string : 'S

The CHECK_SIGNATURE takes a key and a pair of a signature and a hash, and tells us whether the key was used to create the signature:

:: key : pair signature string : 'S -> bool : 'S

Let’s use them:

code {DUP; CAR; IF_NONE{CDR;DUP;CDR;PAIR} # data retrieval branch {DUP; # data update branch DIP{CDDR; DIP{CDR; # access the counters DUP; CAR; CDR}; CMPEQ; # check if counters are equal IF{}{FAIL};}; # fail if not DUP; DUP; DIP{CAR; DIP{CDR; H}; # make a hash of the new data PAIR; DIP{DUP; CAAR}; SWAP; CHECK_SIGNATURE; # check the hash and the supplied signature against the key IF{}{FAIL}}; # fail if not authentic # more code... }

By producing the hash from the supplied data ourselves, we ensure that the signature is valid for the supplied data.

Now we just need to increment the counter and replace the data in storage with the updated value. This is quite straightforward:

code {DUP; CAR; IF_NONE{CDR;DUP;CDR;PAIR} # data retrieval branch { # ...continued CDAR; DIP{CAR; # access the counter DUP; CAR; DIP{CDR; # increment the counter PUSH nat 1; ADD}; PAIR}; SWAP; # replace the data in storage with updated value PAIR; PUSH nat 1; # return a 1 to satisfy the return type PAIR};}

The whole contract is available in this snippet.





Using the contract

Before originating the contract, we need to get a pair of keys - a public key and a private key. Those will be used to sign the data we send to the contract. We can use an existing identity, or generate new ones:

# ./alphanet.sh gen keys (new) ./alphanet.sh client gen keys dataPublisher New secret key alias 'dataPublisher' saved. New public key alias 'dataPublisher' saved. New public key hash alias 'dataPublisher' saved.

Since the keys will be used to publish data in the oracle contract, we called the alias dataPublisher . We can now check the keys:

./alphanet.sh client show identity dataPublisher Hash: tz1h2gexGSLX2xQhd9cqgmdbzoRGBkrEGH4z Public Key: edpkuGfBhAReC5h9G4FR4WhPE5XDyCZpxLreJ5hgMxM86mKaJWGcgG

The private key is not shown to avoid accidentally leaking it. To show it, we can use the show-secret flag:

./alphanet.sh client show identity dataPublisher -show-secret

We have to use the public key when originating the contract:

# ./alphanet.sh client originate contract (new) for (mgr) transferring (qty) from (src) running (prg) [-fee _] [-delegate _] [-force] [-delegatable] [-non-spendable] [-init _] ./alphanet.sh client originate contract oracle for dataPublisher transferring 100 from money running container:oracle.tz -init '(Pair (Pair "edpkuGfBhAReC5h9G4FR4WhPE5XDyCZpxLreJ5hgMxM86mKaJWGcgG" 1) 123456)'

Now that the contract is published, lets see how we are going to call it. We’ll need to get the current value of the counter that prevents replay attacks from its storage, then use it to construct a pair with the updated price, sign the pair and finally initiate a transaction with the signature and the pair as an argument.

Here’s how we get the counter:

# ./alphanet.sh client get storage for (src) ./alphanet.sh client get storage for oracle (Pair (Pair "edpkuGfBhAReC5h9G4FR4WhPE5XDyCZpxLreJ5hgMxM86mKaJWGcgG" 22) 755773)

The alphanet script lets us sign data easily:

./alphanet.sh client man hash and sign Commands for managing the record of known programs: hash and sign data (data) for (name) ask the node to compute the hash of a data expression using the same algorithm as script instruction H, sign it using a given secret key, and display it using the format expected by script instruction CHECK_SIGNATURE (data) the data to hash (name) existing secret key alias ./alphanet.sh client hash and sign data '(Pair 756324 23)' for dataPublisher Hash: "exprtZL5GgGNWd5U3fT2Xyzgewsv2j1sHnWA2ycw3hLQRenLS9s7AP" Signature: "2489b9a4bff9e77a04f6c331a850d4d5397ee1e5021bfacc2ef039a249601740d001931fb8eaa45e6e386a0b859734170a0711fb11b791172eca41ff9fc0ea06"

With the signature, we can finally call the oracle contract and update the data. Remember, we are using the option type, because transactions asking for the data won’t contain anything, while transactions trying to update the data will:

# ./alphanet.sh client transfer (qty) from (src) to (dst) [-fee _] [-arg _] [-force] ./alphanet.sh client transfer 0 from money to oracle -arg '(Some (Pair "2489b9a4bff9e77a04f6c331a850d4d5397ee1e5021bfacc2ef039a249601740d001931fb8eaa45e6e386a0b859734170a0711fb11b791172eca41ff9fc0ea06" (Pair 756324 23)))'

Check the result:

./alphanet.sh client get storage for oracle

As an exercise, you can make the oracle require a certain amount of tez in exchange for providing the data.





The oracle server

The only thing left to do is to write a server that queries the Bitstamp API and updates the data in our contract. You can do this in any language you are comfortable with, I’ll use Go (also known as golang). The syntax is relatively simple and the code should be quite readable even for people who haven’t used golang before.

What do we need to do in order to update the data?

First, we need to query the endpoint, and extract the piece of information that we want to use. The endpoint supplies the data in a JSON:

{"high": "6351.00", "last": "6331.00", "timestamp": "1509458347", "bid": "6327.03", "vwap": "6277.16", "volume": "1183.21242286", "low": "6193.07", "ask": "6330.98", "open": "6200.00"}

We’ll define a type to make things easier:

//TickerHour holds the results of calls to ticker endpoint of Bitstamp API type TickerHour struct { High float32 `json:"high,string"` Last float32 `json:"last,string"` Timestamp int `json:"timestamp,string"` Bid float32 `json:"bid,string"` VWap float32 `json:"vwap,string"` Volume float32 `json:"volume,string"` Low float32 `json:"low,string"` Ask float32 `json:"ask,string"` Open float32 `json:"open,string"` }

Now we can just call the endpoint and let the standard library unmarshaler do the parsing. Our struct will be filled out with fresh data:

const endpoint = "https://www.bitstamp.net/api/v2/ticker_hour/btcusd/" func getData() (TickerHour, error) { var th TickerHour resp, err := http.Get(endpoint) if err != nil { return th, fmt.Errorf("querying http endpoint: %v", err) } b, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body) if err != nil { return th, fmt.Errorf("reading response: %v", err) } err = json.Unmarshal(b, &th) if err != nil { return th, fmt.Errorf("unmarshaling json: %v", err) } return th, err }

Note that we are using a global constant that holds the endpoint URL here, which is a bit dirty. In a more complex system, we might want to make the function more general to allow querying different endpoints.

Another thing to note, if you aren’t familiar with golang, is the error propagation. Errors are treated as regular values, and are usually propagated upwards through the call stack until they are handled, with each function adding a piece of information. This lets us better understand the context of failure, compared to error messages generated by a single function that doesn’t know why it’s being called. This makes for a nicer debugging experience.

We can access the appropriate struct field to use the data:

high := int(th.High * 100)

The decimal part is multiplied out, so we can use it as a natural number in Michelson.

We’d like to push the new price to the oracle contract now. We can follow the same steps described in the section about using the contract, but we will automate them this time.

We split the logic into a few smaller functions, and when they return errors, we push them a channel ch , which we can specify when calling updateData . Channels are are a special type that makes communication between goroutines easier to think about. Goroutines are similar to threads in other languages, but are more lightweight. One goroutine can push some data into a channel and another can be waiting to retrieve them. If no one is waiting for the data, the pushing goroutine will block until the data is needed on the other side – so channels can be used for synchronization. Channels can also have a buffer to avoid blocking the goroutine.

func updateData(ch chan<- error) { th, err := getData() if err != nil { ch <- fmt.Errorf("getting data: %v", err) return } high := int(th.High * 100) counter, err := getCounter(*contract) if err != nil { ch <- fmt.Errorf("getting counter: %v", err) return } signature, err := signData(high, counter, *identity) if err != nil { ch <- fmt.Errorf("signing data: %v", err) return } err = transferData(high, counter, signature, *source, *contract) if err != nil { ch <- fmt.Errorf("transferring data: %v", err) return } }

If you are curious about concurrency in golang and how goroutines and channels work under the hood, you can start with this article about the golang scheduler, or this talk about channels.

The variables identity , source , and contract hold parsed command line arguments. Working with command line arguments is quite simple thanks to the flag package and can be seen in the complete code of the program.

You might have noticed that the function doesn’t return anything. That’s because we are going to be calling this function in a new goroutine, so it would have nowhere to return to. We will get to this later. Let’s see the individual functions now.

We can execute commands from golang code with the os/exec package. One thing that should be noted is that the ALPHANET_EMACS flag needs to be set when calling alphanet.sh from a program, rather than manually. This lets the script know not to run in interactive mode, otherwise it won’t work.

func getCounter(contract string) (int, error) { c := exec.Command("./alphanet.sh", "client", "get", "storage", "for", contract) c.Env = append(c.Env, "ALPHANET_EMACS=true") b, err := c.CombinedOutput() if err != nil { fmt.Println("error:", string(b)) return 0, fmt.Errorf("running commands to get storage: %v", err) } words := strings.Fields(string(b)) w := strings.TrimSuffix(words[3], ")") counter, err := strconv.Atoi(w) if err != nil { fmt.Println(w) return 0, fmt.Errorf("converting output to int: %v", err) } return counter, nil }

We set up a command c and then execute it, capturing the output and error streams. If things are going well, we parse the output and extract the counter. Note that because we are relying on knowing the exact format of the reply, if the output changes in a future update to alphanet.sh , we would need to update the parsing logic here to make it work again. A more resilient approach would be to use a package that parses Michelson data for us.

Signing the data could be done with some golang packages as well, but there’s no reason why we couldn’t just use alphanet.sh . Since exec.Command passes arguments to the command directly, we don’t need to quote the data as we would when calling it through the shell.

func signData(data, counter int, identity string) (string, error) { prepared := fmt.Sprintf("(Pair %d %d)", data, counter) c := exec.Command("./alphanet.sh", "client", "hash", "and", "sign", "data", prepared, "for", identity) c.Env = append(c.Env, "ALPHANET_EMACS=true") b, err := c.CombinedOutput() if err != nil { fmt.Println("error:", string(b)) return "", fmt.Errorf("running commands to sign: %v", err) } lines := strings.Split(string(b), "

") for _, l := range lines { l := strings.TrimSpace(l) if strings.HasPrefix(l, "Signature:") { words := strings.Split(l, " ") signature := strings.Trim(words[1], "\"") return signature, nil } } return "", fmt.Errorf("parsing output: signature not found") }

After signing the data, we only need to send it:

func transferData(data, counter int, signature, source, contract string) error { arg := fmt.Sprintf("(Some (Pair \"%s\" (Pair %d %d)))", signature, data, counter) c := exec.Command("./alphanet.sh", "client", "transfer", "0", "from", source, "to", contract, "-arg", arg) c.Env = append(c.Env, "ALPHANET_EMACS=true") b, err := c.CombinedOutput() if err != nil { fmt.Println("error:", string(b)) return fmt.Errorf("running commands to transfer: %v", err) } return nil }

This is how we get new data and update the contract’s storage. However, we’d like the server to update the contract every hour. We’ll use a time.Ticker to let us know when an hour passes, and a dispatcher that reacts to this signal by calling the updateData function we described above. time.Ticker is a struct containing a channel C , where a timestamp gets pushed once per specified interval.

ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Hour) go dispatchUpdates(shutdown, ticker.C, ch)

The dispatcher runs in its own goroutine and besides creating update goroutines, it also listens for a shutdown signal, to let us exit without leaving any loose ends.

func dispatchUpdates(shutdown <-chan bool, tc <-chan time.Time, ch chan<- error) { fmt.Println("dispatching first update") go updateData(ch) for { select { case _ = <-shutdown: return case _ = <-tc: fmt.Println("dispatching subsequent update") go updateData(ch) } } }

When dispatching an update, we pass the channel ch to updateData so that it can report any errors.

We can limit what can be done with a channel – chan<- is only for pushing data, while <-chan is only for listening. This helps us avoid mistakes when refactoring or fixing bugs. The select statement is analogous to switch , but listens for data on any of the channels instead. Assigning the data to an underscore lets the compiler know we aren’t going to need it (in this case because we only need a binary signal).

The main goroutine listens for errors, and handles shutdown:

func main() { ch := make(chan error) shutdown := make(chan bool) ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Hour) go dispatchUpdates(shutdown, ticker.C, ch) for { select { case err := <-ch: ticker.Stop() shutdown <- true log.Fatal(err) } } }

The whole program is available on my git.

I'm on a tablet on holiday so sorry in advance for the short answer. Your versioned import is the reason why I made it so a plain string UDA is just as good as @Name.

The Supreme Court upheld an Arizona redistricting commission’s right to draw legislative districts in a way that ensures minority representation, delivering a crushing rebuke on Wednesday to a group of Arizona tea party activists who’d sought to strike down the state’s redistricting maps in order to increase the voting power of rural white voters.

In Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, the plaintiffs were taking on Arizona’s Independent Election Commission, a body created through a 2000 ballot initiative intended to make redistricting less partisan. The commission produced its first legislative maps after the 2010 census. Its work came under fire almost immediately, primarily by Republicans. At one point, then-Gov. Jan Brewer (R) attempted to impeach the commission’s chair in what was seen as a power grab. When that failed, in 2012, the Republican-led state legislature filed a lawsuit arguing that the ballot measure that created the commission was unconstitutional because it deprived the legislature of its redistricting power. The lawsuit went all the way to the US Supreme Court, which last June ruled 5-4 in the commission’s favor.

In the current lawsuit, filed in 2014, the plaintiffs, all Republicans, argued that the commission diluted their voting power by packing more people into Republican districts while underpopulating Democratic ones. They wanted the court to mandate that all district have almost exactly equal populations; the current ones vary by 4 to 8 percent. The commission, in turn, responded that it drew the districts in such a way as to win approval from the Justice Department, in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. Due to Arizona’s long history of suppressing minority voting, it was one of the jurisdictions required under the Voting Rights Act to clear any changes to legislative districts with the Justice Department before implementing them. The Supreme Court gutted this requirement in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013, but it was in place when Arizona redrew its legislative maps.

If the Harris plaintiffs had been successful, the case could have opened the floodgates to lawsuits challenging how states around the country draw their legislative districts. But in an opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court ruled unanimously that Arizona’s maps were indeed designed to comply with federal law in ensuring minority representation, and that the minor population deviations were acceptable.

It’s the second time this term the court has rejected challenges to state redistricting plans from tea party conservatives upset about the growing clout of Latino voters. In Evenwel v. Abbott, decided earlier this month, a pair of Texas plaintiffs argued that states should create state legislative districts based on the number of eligible voters in them, as opposed to total population. The move would have granted more power to rural, white areas that lean Republican over more populated urban areas that are home to large minority (and Democratic-leaning) populations. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against the Evenwel plaintiffs.

As with Evenwel, Harris featured an unusual cast of characters. Like Sue Evenwel, lead plaintiff Wes Harris is a tea party activist with a history of anti-immigrant rhetoric. For many years, Harris, the founder of the Original North Phoenix Tea Party, worked at Harris Gunworks, a manufacturing company that specialized in producing sniper rifles, though he can’t own a gun himself because of his felony conviction for aggravated assault in the mid-1990s. “He’s known here as being kind of an extremist,” says Richard Romley, who was the Maricopa County attorney when his office prosecuted Harris.

In an email, Harris denied the relevance of his criminal record. “Dredging up something that happened almost 20 years ago to someone with a previous and since stellar record as a devout citizen of this great country and someone who served in her military is not only a low blow but one beneath most upstanding Christians (assuming you are one) that founded this nation,” he wrote.

In 2012, Harris launched a recall petition against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), largely because he was upset that McCain had come to the defense of Huma Abedin, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest aides, who conservative conspiracy theorists have alleged is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. At the time, Harris told the Arizona Capital Times that Muslims should not be able to serve in government. “Have you ever read the Quran?” he said. “I suggest you do so, because anyone that is a Muslim is a threat to this country, and that’s a fact. There is no such thing as a moderate Muslim. If they are Muslim they have to follow the Quran. That’s their religion and that’s their doctrine.”

Several of his co-plaintiffs are members of a conservative group that backed the state’s widely condemned 2010 law authorizing police officers to stop people at will and demand proof of citizenship. One plaintiff, Karen MacKean, is a field director for Americans for Prosperity, the advocacy group founded by the Koch brothers.

The legal team representing Harris and his co-plaintiffs included conservative pundit Hugh Hewitt and Mark “Thor” Hearne, a conservative lawyer who led the Republican crusade against voter fraud. The financial backers of this legal effort, meanwhile, remain a mystery. Some of the lawyers involved in the case also worked on behalf of Fair Trust, a secretive outfit that battled Arizona’s Independent Election Commission from the start as it drew the state’s legislative districts. Fair Trust was suspected of having ties to members of the state’s Republican congressional delegation. “We could never find out who was paying for” the trust’s work, says Arizona lawyer Colin Campbell, who represented the commission. “I guess you could say it was dark money. We don’t know where it came from.”

Wednesday’s definitive decision should give the commission some temporary relief from the steady stream of litigation it’s seen over the past six years. The decision is hardly a disaster for Republicans, either. Arizona is under Republican control, and it will almost certainly remain that way as long as the current legislative map—the one the court upheld on Wednesday—is in effect, until 2020. A small dose of protection for minority representation does not change that.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The death toll from a suicide bombing in Baghdad this weekend has reached 292, Iraq’s Health Ministry said on Thursday.

The attack, claimed by the militant group Islamic State, which government forces are trying to eject from large parts of the north and west of the country, was the deadliest bombing in Iraq since U.S.-led forces toppled Saddam Hussein 13 years ago.

The militants have lost ground since last year to U.S.-backed government forces and Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias but the weekend bombing showed they can still strike Baghdad despite having lost Falluja, their nearby stronghold, in June.

More than 200 people were wounded in the attack in a busy shopping street in the mainly Shi’ite Karrada district of central Baghdad. About 23 of the wounded were still in hospital, health ministry spokesman Ahmed al-Rudaini told Reuters.

Earlier on Thursday, the ministry had put the toll at 281 and it rose as more people, registered as missing, were identified as dead, Rudaini said.

Iraq Body Count, a volunteer-led organisation that has been counting deaths since 2003, estimates civilian deaths since then at between 160,000 and 180,000, and the toll for violent deaths including combatants at more than 250,000.                                 0279332-44d61e146859a84de459489b8777e1d5.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000015072 00000000000 014665  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        This article is over 1 year old

New York, Philadelphia and Boston closed schools with more than a foot of snow expected, but predictions are revised down as precipitation turns to sleet early

Nearly 100,000 customers were without power in the mid-Atlantic and north-eastern United States on Tuesday as a late winter storm that promised to pummel the north-east with more than a foot of snow turned to sleet early – with heavy precipitation in place of the predicted persistent snowfall on the coast.

By Tuesday evening, most of the east coast was out from under the storm. Residents in northern New England are expected to see wintry conditions persist into early Wednesday morning, while the rest of the mid and north-Atlantic can expect gusty winds and below freezing temperatures – but no more rain or snow – through the night.

The overnight temperature drop, into the mid-20s fahrenheit in New York and Boston, has the potential to create dangerous icy conditions in coastal areas where the majority of the precipitation fell as sleet and rain, as it refreezes on roads, bridges and highways.

Forecasters warned snowy conditions could return in the afternoon, but cut their snowfall predictions for metropolitan areas by several inches early on Tuesday as models showed the storm hitting farther west than initially predicted.

Dominion Power reported more than 50,000 customers in the dark in Virginia on Tuesday morning, with more than 40,000 of those outages in the Richmond area. Maryland officials reported about 30,000 outages. The Massachusetts emergency management agency says at least 62,000 customers experienced outages. Thousands more were reported in Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey and around Philadelphia.

This increased the threat of icy conditions and freezing rain, meaning travel remains dangerous across the north-east.

Although many coastal areas escaped the heavy volume of snow expected, blizzard-like accumulations did materialize further inland, with 18 to 24 inches of snow piling up in large swaths of Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.

Towns along Pennsylvania’s northern tier had nearly 16in before 9am, and nearly 2ft fell in the Pocono mountains.

High winds were measured at the coast, with gusts between 50 and 55mph battering the eastern seaboard. And “thundersnow”, when snow instead of rain is part of a thunderstorm, was detected in New Jersey.

Strong winds toppled a wind turbine at a Narragansett, Rhode Island, beach, where wind gusts had reached up to 55mph. Governor Gina Raimondo said no one was hurt by the falling turbine, which is owned by the state’s department of environmental management.

Meteorologists had predicted snowfall totals as high as 20in (50cm) in New York City from the storm’s start late on Monday through to Tuesday evening, but these predictions were moderated when Tuesday’s early morning snow turned out to instead be predominantly a wintry mix. Four to six inches of snow were now Later forecasts predicted four to six inches of snow.

The National Weather Service’s office near Philadelphia called the storm “life-threatening” and warned people to “shelter in place”. Coastal flooding was also predicted.

At least 6,700 flights scheduled for Tuesday were cancelled and nearly 1,000 flights scheduled for Wednesday have been cancelled. These numbers are expected to rise.

Amtrak cancelled and modified services up and down the north-east corridor and motorists were urged to stay off the roads.

In New York City, the above-ground portions of the subway system were being shut down from 4am on Tuesday. Connecticut’s governor, Dannel P Malloy, imposed a statewide travel ban beginning at 5am.

Amid the storm on Tuesday, Malloy encouraged people to stay home: “Good day to make brownies … and/or read a book”.

The dismal forecast prompted early decisions to close schools on Tuesday in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston and many places in between.

The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel and help keep the roads clear. “If you must go out, do so for as limited time period as possible … but the best thing to do is stay in,” De Blasio said on Monday.

Despite this warning, in the New York City borough of Staten Island, two ponies escaped during the storm. Police wrangled the ponies and returned them to their owner.

The storm comes a week after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s fahrenheit as the first day of spring, 20 March, approaches.

Last week, the 2016-2017 winter became the first on record to have three occurrences of measurable snowfall after a 60F day in New York City.

The storm halted travel around the country and transit officials expect issues to linger after the storm passes.

People were left stranded in airports, including Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, UK, who intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but were stranded at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn’t find a hotel room.

“It’s better safe than sorry, especially flying. I suppose it’s a shame that we can’t get another way around this. It’s just the way it is, unfortunately,” Matthew Balderstone said.

On social media, Americans used the hashtag #snowmageddon2017 to vent their feelings about the impending storm.

The phrase “snowmageddon” was coined ahead of an early February 2010 snowstorm that brought 25-30in of snow across the north-east.

In Washington DC, where the National Cherry Blossom festival is scheduled to start on Wednesday, snow accumulations of 6-8in were expected, leading the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to postpone her trip to Washington for her first face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump. Merkel had been scheduled to arrive late on Monday night for meetings with Trump on Tuesday. The White House said the meeting was rescheduled for Friday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0279292-7410d9f7a8aeef77c2258568fd5ef344.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012610 00000000000 015153  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In the world of internet business, building customer trust is more important than ever before. So, how can you build customer trust is one of the most important questions to answer. Especially early on.

With so many different businesses in the market, there are numerous options not only in goods or services offered but also where to get them from.

What helps the prospect decide whether he should shop at a certain store or not?

It’s credibility and trust of that particular store.

You want to be as transparent as possible when building relationships with your clients or maintaining existing relationships with customers as it helps your business to be recognized as trustworthy.

There are a couple of things every online business can do in order to figure out how to build trust with customers.

1) Mind the design

First impressions matter, and apparently they have a lasting impact on overall opinion of your service or product presented on your homepage. According to various researches, your clients are evaluating your website in a matter of seconds, which means your website has little time to achieve big results.

In order to gain instant trust of your visitors and sell more, you need to invest more time when working with your marketing and design teams creating user friendly layout for the website. Take your time choosing color schemes, images, fonts and logical flow of the information presented.

If you manage to catch your visitors’ attention with attractive design, it is likely they will overlook the minor faults within your site.

Where to start?

Less is more in this case. Be mindful when choosing what to put on your website. Do not overwhelm your visitor with variety of colors and images. Keep your target audience and overall brand image in mind.

Handmade homeware store Zakkia claims to be inspired by Swedish design and beauty of raw materials and finishes. Therefore, minimal design and nature oriented images create a neat overall look to the website that builds immediate trust.

2) Assure safety

Nowadays safety is more important than convenience. You might have great quality products or services to offer, user-friendly website to shop at, but if you cannot provide secure payment connection you are likely to face some difficulties.

Window shoppers take a close look at SSL certificates and third party logos as indicators whether or not store deserves to be trusted. Your prospect will not take risks if he has doubts about the security of the payment gateways you are using to process their credit cards.

That is why make sure you set up a trusted online payment system that is widely recognized by your customers. If you are selling internationally use well-known worldwide services like PayPal. If you are selling locally, use services that are considered safe in your area.

3) Collect reviews

Gathering customer reviews is yet another way that can help you build a trustworthy image of your brand. When it comes to window shopping, reviews of your product left by your previous customers matter.

Prospects are likely to look for reviews of your company or products to learn whether or not it is worth buying from you. The more people leave positive reviews, the more chances you have to convert your prospects into paying customers.

4) Create a blog

Setting up a blog for your business is a great way to connect with your customers. Moreover, it helps to prove your credibility as a company.

Be mindful when choosing what to write about. Blog content should be relevant to the field of business you are in, as well as to products or services you offer. Do not forget to share your content with prospects and encourage them to start a conversation. Your business blog is a direct communication channel that allows you to gradually gain the trust of your prospects.

5) Be transparent

Even though window shopping is not a new phenomenon anymore, customers still have questions they need answers to. The chances are that your prospects are curious not only about shipping rates and product warranties, but also about available payment methods and security of their personal information. If this information is not accessible on your website it can prolong the conversion time, or even result in a lost opportunity.

Customers may also want to assure that you are capable of fulfilling every aspect of their needs. A good footer description, like this one, can tell users what to expect from your brand, regardless of what page they visit.

Depending on what products or services you offer, consider including the following information in your website.

About – What you do? What’s your business philosophy? What’s your story?

Contact – Where are you physically located? How to get in touch with you?

Security & Privacy Policy – How do you handle personal information of your customers?

Return & Refund Policy – Is it possible to return the goods and get a refund?

Shipping Policy – Do you ship internationally? What are the shipping rates?

FAQ – Anything else your online shoppers would want to know or ask.

Even though it takes time to build customer trust, in a long term it pays off.

Moreover, by maintaining a credibility of your company, you have bigger chances to increase customer retention, not even speaking of a word-of-mouth phenomenon that can bring you new possibilities to sell more.

So, to sum-up, this is how you can build customer trust:

Metafilter: 0.2MB

Metafilter’s front page is probably my most-visited and most-interesting thing. It’s a wall of solid text and not a lot of images. Still, the volume of actual content is smaller than the volume of javascript, which itself is about 80% jQuery (minified). It’s not immediately clear to me what jQuery is doing for Metafilter.

Google Homepage: 0.5MB

I don’t actually visit Google.com much and I typically have Javascript suppressed for the domain when I do, but the default experience looks like this: half a megabyte, 60% of which is a single .js file clocking in at 300KB.

OpenStreetMap: 0.64MB

The bulk of OSM’s Javascript use is taken up by OpenLayers, an epic bandwidth hog coming in at 437KB minified. You can build custom, minified versions of OpenLayers with just the features you want; I’ve never successfully gotten one below 250KB. Based on my experience with Modest Maps, I think it should be possible to get the core functionality of OpenLayers across in 100KB, tops. The next 100KB of Javascript on this site is a minified archive of Sizzle and jQuery. The remaining 16% of the bandwidth for this page is the visible map and all other content.

New York Times: 0.76MB

The Times is a toss-up depending on when you’re looking at it; I just reloaded and saw the overall size jump to 1.4MB, then reloaded again and saw it drop to 0.5MB. It’s the front page of a major paper, so the ratio of actual content (text and images) to code and stylesheets looks to be in the 2 or 3 to one range, which is decent.

Github, My User Page: 0.99MB

I spend an inordinate amount of time on Github these days. It’s balanced heavily toward code and stylesheets, with about a three-to-one ratio of framework to content. Github’s Kyle Neath has an excellent presentation on responsive web design where he shows how despite the heavy load of Javascript and CSS used in Github’s interface, the all-important “time to usable” metric is still pretty fast for them. He contrasts this to Twitter, which… ugh, more on them below.

My Home Page: 1.1MB

Here’s me; essentially 100% Actual Content, mostly images. I switched to big, stretchy images a little while back, and I’ve gotten more free with the sizes of things I post.

The Awl: 1.36MB

Page sizes take a sharp upward tick here. Most of The Awl is Javascript, though it appears to be largely custom with the usual slug of jQuery sitting in the middle. A majority comes from widgetserver.com and ytimg.com, so I’m going to guess it’s lightboxes and ad server junk.

The Verge: 7.4MB

Lots and lots of pictures. So many that after a minute or two, I wondered whether something had gone wrong with my network connectivity. Below all the images, there is 300KB of minified jQuery, thanks to the inclusion of jQuery UI. Also, 244KB of fonts which in Safari prevents any text from loading until this item is done.

A Single Tweet: 2.0MB

Twitter allows you send 140 characters in a tweet, which (when you add entities, hashtags, and all that) ends up in the 4KB range as represented in the JSON API. 140 is what you see, so I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest that a single tweet page on Twitter has about a 15,000-to-one ratio of garbage to content.

I get links to tweets by mail, etc. on a regular basis, and the aggressive anti-performance and apparent contempt for the web by Twitter’s designers is probably the thing that gets me most irrationally riled-up on a daily basis. How does this pass design review? Who looks at a page this massive, this typically broken and says “go with it”?

It’s mind-boggling to me that with the high overlap between web developers/designers and iPhone users on AT&T’s network, there isn’t more and smarter attention paid to the sizes of the things we’re slinging around the network. The worst sins of the Flash years are coming back with a vengeance, in the form of CSS Frameworks and the magic dollar sign. There has seriously got to be a better way to do this.0279240-e4629f374779e3348526c7e735c6ca72.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012166 00000000000 014655  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Frank Seravalli TSN Senior Hockey Reporter Follow|Archive

MONTRÉAL — It was fitting that Nick Holden’s shattered stick laid in ruin between Henrik Lundqvist’s pads when Tomas Plekanec potted the biggest goal of his career.

The Rangers defenceman broke his stick on Plekanec - preventing him from defending the game-tying goal - because a stubborn Plekanec wouldn’t move, like he hasn’t from Montreal since 2004.

One cross-check. Another shove. Whack.

Canadiens are alive. Somehow.

“He was at the right place, at the right time,” coach Claude Julien said. “He did what he was supposed to do as far as being in front of the net.”

That Plekanec was even on the ice in the dying minute of regulation, with Montreal seconds away from being in a two-game chokehold at the hands of the Rangers, was a shock in itself.

This was Plekanec’s worst offensive season of his career. Fans were calling for a reduced role, a demotion to the fourth line, where he could continue as an effective penalty killer and defensive specialist.

All he did was save the Canadiens’ season since teams down 2-0 in a best-of-seven series go on to lose 87 per cent of the time in NHL history.

Plekanec knotted Game 2 with 17.3 seconds left, capping off a furious third period push, before Alexander Radulov bulldozed the game-winner behind Lundqvist in overtime to send this Eastern Conference first round series to New York all square.

Game 3 is Sunday night at Madison Square Garden, where the Rangers collected the worst home record among all playoff teams this season.

“We played desperate all period,” Plekanec said. “I think you could see in that third period, every single guy was desperate, played hard to get that goal. We believed. This is a tight group. We showed that tonight.”

The Habs had the Rangers, comfortable to nurse an opportunistic 3-2 lead, on their heels for the entire third period but had nothing to show for it. Until Plekanec.

After sitting back in a prevent-style defence, sending only one forechecker for the majority of the third, the Rangers had a tough time transitioning back to a full-ice attack in overtime. Montreal had all the momentum. The Canadiens now have four more wins (12) when trailing after two periods than any team in the NHL this season to show for it.

“We knew our backs were against the wall,” Max Pacioretty said. “We knew what the buzz was like after losing one game. You don’t want to go down 2-0. It’s just one win. It’s very, very important, but it’s something very, very good to build off of as well.”

The win marked not only the Canadiens’ first playoff overtime triumph in Montreal over the Rangers in 60 years, but more importantly, the first playoff victory by a Canadian team in 707 days. The Habs took home Canada’s last Stanley Cup playoff win back on May 9, 2015, nearly two full years ago.

Plekanec, now 34, was there for that. He’s been in the middle of it all for the Canadiens since making his NHL debut on New Year’s Eve in 2003.

Plekanec and Andrei Markov are the last remaining holdovers from Julien’s first tenure, which lasted from 2003-06. Only eight other players in the NHL have remained with the same team for that entire time.

His career has come full circle with Julien, the man who helped develop him in Hamilton in the AHL, gave him his shot in the NHL, and put him out there in the final minute of play on Friday.

“Time flies,” Plekanec said. “It’s been so long. I barely spoke English back in the day.”

Julien’s re-hiring almost breathed a second wind into Plekanec’s career. Not every coach, even those who rely on veteran experience, would have continued with Plekanec in such a meaningful role centring the second line with key power play minutes.

Some would criticize Julien for showing that much faith in Plekanec, or call it bias toward viewing Plekanec through a lens of how he used to play, rather than how he plays now. Plekanec collected just 10 goals and 18 assists for 28 points in 78 games; his previous low was 29 points in 67 games in his first full NHL season more than a decade ago.

“His teammates see him do all the sacrifices of playing against top lines on most nights and on most shifts and really doing a great job of shutting them down,” Julien said. “He’s taken a lot of pride in that. Sometimes it’s not the funnest job. I don’t know if funnest is a word, but it’s not the job you enjoy the most and he takes pride in it and he does it well.

“For him to get rewarded like that makes everybody feel good.”

Plekanec downplayed his relationship with Julien, saying so much time had passed since their first run, that it wasn’t immediately like old times when he was re-hired in February. But the confidence Julien has displayed has paid off.

“Sometimes, it’s funny to see how careers end up,” Plekanec said. “You meet up with guys, whether it’s teammates or coaches, that you started with. Sometimes it’s crazy like that. My role is what it is. I accept that. It’s great for the team. There are other guys that can play on the top lines. I’m not here for my personal goals.”

He spoke from Warsaw, Poland, where he is meeting with NATO leaders.

According to News.com.au, Obama described the attack as “twisted” and said, “There’s no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement.”

He then signaled a coming push for more gun control, saying:

We also know that when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately, it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic. In the days ahead, we are going to have to confront those realities as well.

Throughout his second term in office Obama has demonstrated a tendency to respond to any type of firearm-related attack with calls for more gun control, including gun control that is already in place yet failing miserably in certain U.S. states and/or foreign countries–like France.

Two days after the October 1 attack in the gun-free zone of Umpqua Community College in Oregon he even hinted at firearm confiscation.

Kennedy assassination might reveal about 1960s Miami?

Here's his story:

If the federal government makes good on a 25-year-old pledge Thursday and releases 30,000 secret documents about the Kennedy assassination, the results might look a little bit like a 1963 Miami phone book.

The trove of files, mostly from the CIA and FBI, contains thousands of documents on South Florida people and organizations involved in efforts to topple Fidel Castro's communist Cuban government in the early 1960s, when that was practically Miami's leading industry.

Under a law enacted in 1992, the documents — supposedly the last batch of classified government files on the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy — must be opened to the public no later than Thursday unless President Donald Trump intervenes to block the process.

Trump tweeted last weekend that he would go through with the declassification. But he left himself a bit of wiggle room by adding that his promise was "subject to the receipt of further information."

Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017

That was a reference to fierce lobbying by the CIA and FBI to keep at least some of the documents secret — an effort that is still going on. "[CIA chief] Mike Pompeo is definitely fighting hard to hold them back," said Roger Stone, a longtime on-and-off Trump political associate.

Stone is also a Kennedy assassination researcher — his 2013 book “The Man Who Killed Kennedy” — argued that Vice President Lyndon Johnson was behind the killing — and he said he spoke to the president a week ago, urging that the release take place.

Stone is convinced that it will. But he noted that the last batch of assassination documents to be released was so heavily censored ("redacted," in CIA-speak) that much of it was useless. "I'm not confident we won't have that again, that there won't be a back-door bureaucratic effort to nullify the president's decision," he said.

Roger Stone, a longtime on-and-off Trump political associate, urged the release of the documents.

Censorship isn't the only threat to the documents. The National Archive's last release of assassination files, in July, was marred by cyber-crash-and-burns that locked up computers for hours at a time. And researchers who got through found many of the documents were impenetrable pastiches of CIA jargon and code words.

"A lot of these files are going to be written in the language of the CIA's operational directorate, which is not easy for outsiders to comprehend," warned former CIA analyst Brian Latell, author of "Castro's Secrets: Cuban Intelligence, The CIA, and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy," which contends that the assassination was carried out with at least the knowledge — and perhaps even help — of the Castro regime.

Whether any of the South Florida-linked files are among those being hotly contested is impossible to know. But some assassination researchers told the Miami Herald that it's likely they are.

"The CIA is not trying to keep these things hidden because there's a signed confession to the Kennedy assassination in the archives," said Gerald Posner, the Miami Beach author of "Case Closed," which argues strongly that the assassination was not the result of a conspiracy. "It's doing it because there's stuff that's embarrassing. And one thing that might be embarrassing is some of the activities of these anti-Castro groups that the CIA was friendly with."

A peek inside the cyber-backdoor of the National Archives, where the documents are housed, reveals that many of those groups, their members and their associates are the subject of classified files. Using a digital search engine that the archives maintains to help it keep track of exactly what files it has, the Herald located nearly 3,000 files linked to various anti-Castro groups and figures — though their exact contents remains secret:

▪ Among the biggest caches of documents — over 1,600 pages of them — concerns militant Cuban exiles Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch, who lived in the Miami area off and on beginning in the 1960s. (Bosch died in 2011; Posada Carriles is believed to still be here.)

They partnered in various violent attacks on targets associated with the Castro regime — including, allegedly, the bombing of a Cubana airline flight that killed 77 people, though they denied it and were never convicted. Bosch specialized in bombings of Cuban diplomatic posts, Posada Carriles in attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro. His last known one, in Panama, took place in 2000. He was convicted, then pardoned.

▪ Convicted Watergate burglars Virgilio González, Bernard Barker, James McCord, Eugenio Martínez, and Frank Sturgis, along with their former CIA boss, Howard Hunt, are mentioned in a collective 764 pages of files. All the men participated in militant anti-Castro attacks, and all lived in Miami at various times from the 1960s onward. Hunt, Barker and Sturgis have all died. The others live in South Florida.

▪ More than a thousand pages of the classified files refer to Manuel Artime, who helped plan the CIA-backed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion and then was captured ashore. Ransomed home by the U.S. government, he was on stage next to president Kennedy during a huge "welcome home" rally for captured participants in the invasion. Living in Miami, he spent the next several years on armed attacks on Cuba; he died in 1977.

▪ Ricardo Morales, better known by the nickname Monkey as he moved through the nightscape of Miami conspiracy and narcotrafficking in the early 1980s, is the subject of 172 pages of documents. A former Cuban intelligence officer who defected in 1960, Morales spent several years under contract with the CIA as a paramilitary officer, fighting secret wars in, among other places, Africa. Later he turned to freelance anti-Castro work — he, too, was accused but never convicted of involvement in the bombing of the Cubana airliner — and then drug-running. He was shot to death in a Key Biscayne bar brawl in 1982.

▪ Tony Cuesta, who blew off a hand and an eye during a 1966 raid on Cuba by his Miami-based militant group Commandos L but continued to mastermind attacks against the island until he died in 1992, is the subject of 48 pages. Two other Miami-based anti-Castro groups, Alpha 66 and the Revolutionary Student Directorate, figure in 112 pages.

Both Cuba and Miami-based anti-Castro exiles have long been near the center of the vast complex of theories about who killed Kennedy. The motive for the exiles, supposedly, is their rage at the lack of U.S. battlefield help during the Bay of Pigs invasion, particularly Kennedy's decision at the last minute to pull American air support.

Castro's purported motive is more direct: his knowledge that the Kennedy administration was trying to kill him through various exotic CIA-supplied weapons, including an exploding seashell and a poisoned diving suit. The Cuban dictator had even issued a not very veiled threat to an American reporter in Havana: "U.S. leaders should think if they are aiding terrorist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders they themselves will not be safe."

To add intrigue to the Cuba angle, Lee Harvey Oswald — the malcontent Texas Marxist who fired the bullets that killed Kennedy, according to the much-disputed official investigation conducted after the assassination by the Warren Commission — visited the Cuban and Russian embassies in Mexico City about six weeks before the assassination in search of visas to visit the two countries.

Journalist-historian Jefferson Morley believes that the documents scheduled for release this week may shed more light on what Oswald was up to and, more importantly in his view, what the CIA knew about him.

Morley's new book, "The Ghost: The Secret Life of CIA Spymaster James Jesus Angleton," offers evidence that Angleton — one of the most powerful yet cryptic spies in the history of American intelligence — knew Oswald was in Mexico and was following his activities closely.

Morley notes 151 pages of testimony Angleton gave in secret in 1975 to a U.S. Senate investigating CIA activities is among the documents scheduled for declassification. He think it may include material on Oswald's visit to Mexico.

"Angleton was interested in Oswald from the start and used him for intelligence purposes," Morley told the Herald. "From these files, we might find out a lot more about what those purposes were."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279154-e59501592e4f1a7cdf3c329f0838266e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005220 00000000000 014773  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

If you put $5 into the office March Madness pool with the hope of creating a perfect bracket, here’s a tip: You should have bought a lottery ticket instead.



The odds of picking a perfect bracket in the annual NCAA men’s basketball tournament are one in 9.2 quintillion, according to calculations by Jeff Bergen, a mathematics professor at DePaul University.

That’s if you’re the type of person who picks teams based on whether you like the mascot or fancy the team uniform. The chances get a little better if you actually know something about basketball.

According to Bergen’s calculations, a person with a little understanding of team rankings and other data has perhaps a 1 in 128 billion chance of correctly calling every game in the March Madness tournament, which begins in earnest Thursday and runs through April 8.

To put that in perspective, you’re still much more likely to be the sole winner of a big lottery jackpot. The odds of being the sole winner of last year’s Powerball jackpot were around 175 million to one.

A perfect bracket could be done – but there’s no known case of it ever happening.

“If you ran tournaments for 64 billion years, you’re eventually going to have someone with a perfect bracket,” Bergen said. “But for just a single event, it’s highly unlikely.”

Of course, you don’t need a perfect bracket to win an office March Madness pool. You just need to do better than anyone else in your pool.

Plus, part of the allure of the NCAA tournament is that it is notoriously difficult to predict. That’s what gives the office cat lover who might watch basketball twice a year a feeling that he or she just may beat out the fanatic fan who has spent hours watching every game and poring over every statistic.

Nate Silver, the FiveThirtyEight blogger and data geek who successfully called the presidential election last year, spoke this week about how tough it is to even successfully call a March Madness winner now that there is more parity among the teams.

His incredibly complex formula makes clear just how hard: It only gives his top pick, Louisville, about a one in five chance of winning.

Bergen, the math professor, doesn’t fill out March Madness brackets anymore. He said his family used to have a contest where everyone would fill out a bracket and the person who had the worst bracket would have to buy everyone pizza.

Supporters of the bills call them a move toward transparency and accountability, while opponents say the measures are meant to intimidate judges and cut off abortion access.

If either measure passes, Texas would become the first state to make public personally identifying information about the judges and courts involved in “judicial bypass” cases. Critics say this could have a chilling effect, leaving minors with even fewer options.

“Nobody knows what decisions they make, nobody knows if this really is a pro-choice or pro-life judge or whatever because the decisions aren’t public,” Ben Lancaster, chief of staff for Republican state Rep. Ron Simmons, told the Dallas Morning News. Simmons is the sponsor of the measure that would make public the names of judges who oversee these cases.

But making such information public could intimidate judges, said Elizabeth Nash of the Guttmacher Institute. “That raises a lot of red flags when you start asking for very specific information about the judge or the county or the type of court,” she explained. “That could potentially be used against them and could be a way to encourage judges not to grant these petitions.”

Susan Hays, a Dallas lawyer who represent minors in judicial bypass cases, put a finer point on it in a comment to the Morning News. “They want the judges’ heads on a plate,” Hays said. “It is absolutely the goal to punish them at the ballot box.”

There are 38 states that require a parent be informed (or, in some states, give consent) before a minor can have an abortion, but judicial bypass allows young people to work around this requirement. It can be an arduous process, but it’s often invoked by young people who can’t involve their parents in their decision for any number of reasons, including parents who have been deported, incarcerated or guardians who were never granted legal guardianship. Violence -- a history of abuse and the threat of violence -- is also a reason given by many young people seeking judicial bypass.

Jane’s Due Process, a Texas organization that provides legal counsel to minors seeking judicial bypass, collects stories from the teens they work with. Violence factors into most, if not all, their testimonials.

Here’s one:

My father has beaten me. He put me in a convent for 6 months for smoking. My cousin was sent away from her family when she got pregnant because she wasn't married. Can you imagine what my father would do to me for this? He's also threatened to hurt my boyfriend.

And another:

When I told my dad I was pregnant the first time and that I wanted to have an abortion, he told me that it would never happen. He said that I needed to be punished. He told me I would have the baby and that he would beat me for the next 7 days. For 7 days, he beat me with his belt. After I moved out, he used to come by my house and yell at me 'to get ready' as he took out his belt so he could 'punish' me more.

And another:

Yes, my mother has told me more than once that if I get pregnant, she will beat that baby out of me. I believe her.

Reproductive rights activists and child advocates also say the laws could make an already dire situation much worse. Even with the status quo, many minors can’t access judicial bypass, according to research from Jane’s Due Process.

More from Houston Press:

[M]ore than a third of the counties [Jane’s Due Process] called said they didn't handle judicial bypasses or couldn't provide any of the paperwork necessary to file an application (essentially refusing girls the option); nearly half of the counties gave the caller inaccurate information about the process; the clerk's office employee in one county told the caller she was an "advocate for crisis pregnancy centers," state-funded centers that offer pregnant women dubious and scientifically inaccurate information in hopes of persuading them not to have an abortion, and asked the caller to meet her in person after work to talk about her options; another clerk's office simply hung up on the caller.

Despite the very real threat such a law would pose to young peoples’ health and safety, supporters of the measures say they want to "protect" minors. Texas Right to Life calls judicial bypass a “loophole” that has been “exploited by the abortion industry.”

“This judicial bypass loophole supersedes parental rights and authority and endangers our young girls in Texas,” reads a statement on the group's website.

In response to the robbery, John 5 has posted photos of some of the stolen items on Facebook with the hope that someone out there will identify and return a few, if not all, of his most prized possessions.

Among the items stolen from John 5's house are a number of Fender Telecasters, a black Gibson Les Paul with three gold humbucking pickups, a banjo and a piece of artwork depicting the monster from 'The Creature From the Black Lagoon.' John 5 also added a photo of his signature '5' strap to help identify an instrument that could possibly belong to the strummer.

John 5 reached out to his fans via Facebook :

Unfortunately our house was robbed today, we accidentally didn't put the alarm on, so some assholes got lucky! We will post more pictures of more guitars, these are all the pictures we have now. I just want to put it out there, just in case anyone comes across these items.. Whoever did this will get caught hopefully one day!

John 5 is planning to post additional pictures of items stolen from his home, so keep your eyes open for further updates. John 5's latest contribution to the world of music, Rob Zombie's upcoming 'Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor,' is set for an April 23 release. Rob Zombie and his crew will also headline this year's Mayhem Festival in the summer.

He is lamenting the continuing destruction by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (known as Isis) of some of mankind’s most important ancient monuments in what is widely regarded to be the “cradle of civilisation”, Mesopotamia, a region that includes modern-day Iraq. The Syrian Heritage Initiative monitors historic sites at risk, offering the US Department of State some clarity in the fog of war.

The heritage of the Middle East has been heavily hit. In the past week Isis has seized control of the Greco-Roman city of Palmyra, which lies on a strategic east-west route in war-torn Syria.

Natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes join the litany of human aggression, theft and errors of judgment to bring about destruction, collapse and loss. The recent fire at Clandon Park in Surrey is just the latest of the UK’s man-made calamities, erasing its exquisite Italianate interiors. It reminded many of Uppark, in West Sussex, which burnt down in 1989, and of Windsor Castle, which suffered a similar fate in 1992. It is clear we cannot save everything we’d like to, for all time. Preservation is too great a burden for many developed countries. The UK government has given its national property portfolio of more than 400 sites to English Heritage; it is now a charity case and someone else’s problem. Meanwhile, warmongers target prominent monuments and the weather grows more extreme.

So what can, and should, preservation groups, academics and authorities do against overwhelming odds? If we are resigned to the vulnerability of historic buildings to the forces of nature, it is tempting to think we might mitigate the effects of war through protection. But first, the motives for destruction by human hand need to be understood.

A carving at Nimrud, an ancient Assyrian city in Iraq, parts of which have been destroyed by Isis

Much of the current damage in Iraq and Syria has been choreographed by Isis; what we witness is their footage. A video posted on April 11, 2015 shows the fate of the Northwest Palace at Nimrud, a city in ancient Assyria 3,000 years ago, lying 25 miles south of Mosul, the city Isis has occupied for the past year. An exceptional and irreplaceable cultural achievement was defaced and blown up.

Eckart Frahm, professor of Assyriology at Yale University, sees a pattern in the targeting of religious shrines before the more blatantly political attacks on ancient monuments. “Isis is strongly opposed to the idea of nation states built upon . . . [pre-Islamic] traditions, and therefore seeks to destroy the material remains of those traditions,” he says.

Danti explains a further complexity: the way in which jihadi ideology promotes the notion that its members are engaged in tasfiya, the cleansing of Islam of foreign or corrupting elements. “The majority of their deliberate attacks target Islamic heritage deemed as bidaa (innovative/heretical) and shirk (idolatrous/polytheistic). Their attacks on pre-Islamic heritage stem from their belief that they must destroy anything deemed shirk. They are fond of citing passages of the Koran that describe Abraham’s destruction of idols to legitimise their actions.”

An account of the destruction of Nimrud featured in Dabiq, Isis’s propaganda publication, quotes terminology used by some western preservation organisations. “They entered the ruins of the ancient Assyrians in Wilayat Ninawa and demolished their statues, sculptures, and engravings of idols and kings. This caused an outcry from the enemies of the Islamic State, who were furious at losing a ‘treasured heritage’. The mujahidin, however, were not the least bit concerned about the feelings and sentiments of the kuffar [non-believers].”

Danti also sees a financial benefit in the pillaging of antiquities. “An alarming amount of damage is intentional: looting of antiquities from archaeological sites, deliberate targeting of heritage places in combat [ . . . ] Isis has a deliberate and systematised policy of attacking heritage, looting cultural property, and destroying cultural infrastructure.”

The motives of ideology, antipathy, erasure and profit are yet to elicit an armed response in defence of cultural property. In a Unesco press statement on Iraq in February, Irina Bokova, the director-general, reiterated her previous statements on the matter. “The systematic destruction of iconic components of Iraq’s rich and diverse heritage that we have been witnessing over the past months is intolerable and it must stop immediately.”

Unfortunately, the impression of reiteration is impotence. Danti goes further: “I am afraid public resolutions condemning Isis attacks on cultural heritage sites are not really helpful and perhaps even counterproductive [ . . . ] official statements condemning their barbaric acts will only prompt supporters of the group to intensify their destructive activities.”

So if we cannot change things, can we change the way we think about this issue? Emma Cunliffe, a specialist in Syrian cultural heritage at Oxford university’s Endangered Archaeology of the Middle East and North Africa programme, says that “in some extreme, and particularly devastating, cases, the records may be the only thing left of a culture, in which case we owe it to them to preserve something, anything.” More philosophically, she suggests that equating authenticity with provenance is a western concept. This may sound odd, as many people hold that crafted manifestations of imagination and effort are irreplaceable by facsimiles. But some cultures routinely rebuild ancient monuments. In Japan, ancient pagodas are celebrated that have been rebuilt perhaps 10 times, but which inherit their original ethos and form, which represent the soul of the object above its materiality.

In western countries, it is rare to encounter an ancient building that has not been restored or repaired. We pretend that the march of time can be harnessed. Should we get over our own delusions and accept that the patrimony can be replicated? The painstaking rebuilding of Warsaw after the second world war suggests we could.

Military protection aside, three strategic approaches to “new preservation” are generally favoured. The first of these is the use of archaeological technology in still-accessible areas to record monuments in high resolution. Leicester and Oxford Universities have been backed by the Arcadia charity fund to deliver a £1.2m, two-year aerial reconnaissance programme, led by Dr Robert Bewley, who estimates that there are between 3m and 5m archaeological sites in the Middle East and north Africa.

The fire at Clandon Park House in Surrey, UK, in April

Meanwhile, a California non-profit called CyArk is attempting precise, on-the-ground 3D laser surveying of 500 assorted global monuments, including the British Museum’s Assyrian panels. Combining these visual technologies for sites in volatile zones could enable appreciation and study, and inform future reconstructions.

Second, we might recognise that modern construction methods have replaced many of the traditional skills that constantly replenish our cultural inheritance. The Prince’s Foundation is one notable attempt to develop an international ethos of craft and design skills and to reinstate those traditions.

The third possibility is to stall the economic benefits of looting by better policing of the international antiquities market. The International Council of Museums (Icom) has published an online guide to the types of artefacts that emerge from pillaged sites, including sculptures and architectural elements. Twitter feeds, for example that of the archaeologist Sam Hardy (@conflictantiq), offer information and updates on destruction and looting. Governments are starting to crack down: in April, Lebanon declared its intention to police illicit antiquities better, while Unesco has developed the #Unite4Heritage campaign to engage younger people in the care of sites.

“Finally,” says Eckart Frahm, “we should do everything we can to support our colleagues from the countries affected by the violence — the Iraqi and Syrian archaeologists and historians. They will be the ones whose work will matter most once Isis is gone.”

Trump is so corrupt that if Democrats controlled even one chamber of Congress, he'd be done before he even got started. #2018 — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) December 27, 2016

So Trump– the shadiest, most corrupt guy to take the Oval Office, will have no strong federal checks and balances. Has to change. #2018 — Julián Castro (@JulianCastro) December 27, 2016

Following the election last month, Castro said, “It’s up to [Trump] more than anybody to make sure he approaches the presidency differently from how he approached the campaign. Being president isn’t like being a campaigner. One of the things he benefited from is very, very low expectations.”

2. The minimum wage should be much, much higher. The minimum wage here? $7.25. In Australia? $14.50, and their unemployment rate is lower.

3. There should be a maximum pay rate, too. In Switzerland, a proposal came to a vote last week to limit executive pay according to how much the company’s lowest-paid worker makes. Swiss voters rejected the proposal, but the issue of a widening income gap remains a priority in the country.

4. Every person should earn an income. Another idea proposed in Switzerland would give “a monthly income to every citizen, no strings attached,” according to The New York Times.

5. Vacation should be a basic human right. This idea comes from Europe, specifically the European Union, which in 2010 announced plans to subsidize vacations for those who struggle to afford them.

6. Assault weapons should be banned. After 35 people were murdered by a single man in Australia in the mid-1990s, the government banned shotguns and assault weapons, enacted stricter licensing rules and launched a number of gun buyback programs. Within roughly a decade, gun-related murders were down nearly 60 percent.

7. Public universities should be free. What used to be the norm at U.S. public universities still is in Argentina and many other countries.

8. The government should support artists. Anyone with an art-school degree in Germany can get government benefits, so long as they continue to apply for grants and scholarships, a decision that helps keep struggling artists afloat.

9. Big corporate boards should be diverse. A new proposal in Germany would require companies listed on DAX, the country’s stock exchange, to fill nearly one-third of “supervisory” board seats with women.

10. Cancer patients shouldn’t miss out out on pay. In both Norway and Luxembourg, a worker who must miss work for a 50-day cancer treatment gets paid for each one of those days, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

11. No one should work in the dark. Again, Germany. The country requires offices to have a “view of the sky,” according to The Telegraph.

12. Parents should get time off to watch their kids grow up. Over a child’s first eight years of life, Swedish parents receive 480 potential days off from work, in which they're still paid a significant share of their wages.

Now they begin work on convincing the IOC to send the Summer Games to the Hub.

Boston beat San Francisco, Los Angeles and Washington on Thursday to be the USOC's choice for the American bid. A day later, bid officials spoke to reporters at Boston's shiny convention center along with Mayor Marty Walsh and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker.

Walsh announced the first nine community meetings to discuss plans with residents. He vowed to make the bid process the most transparent in Olympic history. Baker reminded residents that this is just the start of the process.

Bid chairman John Fish dipped into the local dialect, saying he is "wicked excited."

Baker and Walsh also tried to calm skeptics who fear public money will be misspent in an international process that has been plagued in the past by corruption, CBS Boston reports.

"I promise this will be the most open, inclusive and transparent process in Olympic history," Walsh said, adding that taxpayer dollars will not be used to build venues in the city of Boston.

Meanwhile, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach says Boston will be a "strong" contender to host the 2024 Games.

Bach says in a statement today "the Boston bid will be a strong one."

The U.S. hasn't hosted the Summer Olympics since 1996 in Atlanta. New York failed in a bid for the 2012 Games, and Chicago was rejected for 2016.

Bach says Boston's bid "has the great potential to build on the strength of the athletes from the US Olympic Team."

Boston joins Rome as the only other city that has officially decided to bid.

CBS Boston reports that the protest group, No Boston Olympics, promised to keep fighting Friday, stressing that the state's priorities should include safe communities, quality education and responsible environmental policies.

"That's why we need your continued support as we move forward. Please join us for a public meeting on Wednesday, January 16th to be held in Boston or Cambridge. And its not just Metro Boston residents who should join, but citizens and taxpayers in Worcester, Springfield, North Adams, Dartmouth, and Lowell - citizens across the Commonwealth who will bear the risk from the promises Boston2024 has made to the USOC, all without public input," the group said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                0279339-5b5f1dfcc3402baf57a49e77c4216d9f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011551 00000000000 015273  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Get the biggest Liverpool FC stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

It’s been a big issue at Liverpool for each of the past two summers.

Striker. Striker. Striker. Goals. Goals. Goals.

In both 2014 and 2015, the Reds’ transfer window revolved around finding that elusive frontman. They tried – and failed – to replace Barcelona-bound Luis Suarez, and then 12 months later attempted to rectify the previous year’s errors.

No fewer than six forwards have been signed in that period, at a total cost approaching £100m. The results, however, have been mixed. By the time September comes, the likelihood is that three of those six will have been moved on – without profit.

It’s a dangerous cycle, chasing your own mistakes in the transfer market. It can cost you time, money and respect. It’s a cycle Liverpool have been in for too long.

So will the summer of 2016 be the same as those that have preceded it?

Is there any need for a frontman?

On the face of it, it shouldn’t be. Sure, Liverpool intend to be busy, and will look to strengthen both team and squad before the new campaign. It's never quiet at Melwood during the summer months.

They’ve already sealed deals for four players – a goalkeeper, a central defender, winger and a central midfielder – and we know of interest in a left back and another central midfielder at the very least.

The pure striking front, though, appears quiet.

Yes, the rumour mill will continue to link Liverpool with names. Jamie Vardy and Gonzalo Higuain cropped up last month. “Nothing in it,” was the word when those stories were checked out.

Are Liverpool’s forward options for 2016/17 already in place then? And if so, are they sufficient, especially given Christian Benteke is apparently set for a £30m switch to Crystal Palace?

The statistics suggest that goalscoring was not a huge issue for the Reds last season. Their league tally of 63 was only five shy of champions Leicester City, and eight off Manchester City, the Premier League’s top scorers. They managed 14 more than Louis Van Gaal’s Manchester United.

The goals were spread, too; five of their squad reached double figures in all competitions.

Four of them will certainly be in Jurgen Klopp’s plans come January. The other, Benteke, seems to have lost his battle to convince the manager of his worth, but is not being allowed to leave on the cheap at least. Add in Danny Ings, fit again after a long-term knee injury, and the Reds look pretty well stocked in terms of goalscorers – even if they are still too reliant on the fragile fitness of Daniel Sturridge for most fans’ liking.

A good blend?

At 26, Sturridge is the veteran of the current crop and much, as ever, will depend on his ability to stay injury-free throughout the course of next season.

He was the Reds’ leading scorer this term, his 13 goals coming from just 19 starts. He’s the best finisher, has the slickest movement and is one of the few players in the squad capable of jaw-dropping, match-winning moments in and around the penalty area. Offer Liverpool 30 games worth of Sturridge next season and they’d bite your hand off.

Alongside him Divock Origi’s progression was one of the real highlights of the campaign. The young Belgian grew in stature, presence and composure. Ten goals in his first season in a new country at the age of 20, and from just 15 starts, screams potential. He’ll only get better, you would imagine.

Likewise Roberto Firmino, whose best performances came when asked to play further forward, and whose first year in England will have taught him plenty about the demands of a league like the Premier League – and a club like Liverpool. He’ll be targeting more than his 11 goal tally of last season, and is a huge favourite of Klopp’s.

It looks a good blend, especially with Ings’ pace and willing thrown into the mix.

When chasing up Liverpool’s reported interest in Vardy, one of the reasons given to knock it down was that the club felt they already had a player of such qualities in Ings, who likes to run in behind, works tirelessly and has a decent eye for goal.

The former Burnley man is desperate to make up for time lost last season. His presence in the squad can only benefit the Reds.

The arrival of Sadio Mane from Southampton not only brings in pace and width but another goal threat with the Senegalese notching 15 in all competitions last season. He has looked dangerous playing through the middle and like Firmino, could easily be used in that role on occasions.

In the meantime, then, Klopp and his recruitment team will continue to work.

Unlike previous years, though, their season does not seem to rest on their ability to find the right striker. Just the right goalkeeper, defender, winger and midfielders....                                                                                                                                                       0279320-e8331674e0b8c793143120636cb8ab68.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003143 00000000000 014614  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        We aimed to assess whether anxiety and depression influence a patient's subjective symptom scores in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Fifty-seven consecutive patients referred with CRS were asked to complete Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT22) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) questionnaires. Spearman's rank correlation was used to test association between SNOT22 and HADS. Linear regression was used to simultaneously analyse SNOT, HADS, patient age and gender. Mean anxiety score was 7.9 (range 0-19) with 32 % scoring over 11 (A score of ≥ 11 for either anxiety or depression is suggestive). Mean depression score was 5.0 (range 0-17), with 11 % scoring over 11. Five patients scored over 11 for both domains in the HADS questionnaire. Total SNOT22 and both anxiety (Spearman's ρ = 0.48, p = 0.0002) and depression scores (ρ = 0.44, p = 0.0007) revealed a strong association. We also identified a very strong association between psychological symptoms (questions 11-20) in SNOT22 and anxiety (ρ = 0.60, p = 0.0001) and depression scores (ρ = 0.341, p = 0.002). However, there was no association between nose-specific symptoms in SNOT22 and anxiety score in HADS (ρ = 0.18, p = 0.1775), but there was a strong association between nose-specific symptoms of SNOT22 and depression score in HADS (ρ = 0.32, p = 0.02). There is a strong association between total SNOT 22 and HADS score, but this appears to be due to the impact on generic quality of life items rather than disease-specific symptoms. This supports inclusion of global items in the SNOT22, but also use of two separate subscales when interpreting data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279380-0d62c5c0ef2c63a53147eb9da4fe35e2.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001335 00000000000 015251  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Starting off with yet another amazing Lemaitre song, I gotta say, I just love the style of music. That being, fun, electro, and all amazing.

A new song from Zedd got released this week, and this subreddit helpfully reminded me of it. It's a great song that incorporates good vocals and keeps it interesting throughout despite being on the bit longer side of 6 minutes.

Next up is a mashup or Porter Robinson, Knife Party and to top it off, some 12th Planet. This amazing mix of artists leads to a suprisingly good mashup.

It's been a while since I've done an artist feature, but this sub seems to have gotton interested in Adventure Club so I've decided to include a couple of songs.

Hear The Music King Tubby Meets the Rockers Uptown Eleuthera

The sound of one of this year's Grammy-nominated reggae albums, Harlem-Kingston Express Live, may seem perplexing at first. But don't let the blend of swing and dub confuse you: That's just the unique sound of pianist Monty Alexander.

Alexander's music has variously been described as bebop, calypso and reggae. But after 50 years in music and more than 70 albums, he's earned the right to call his music simply his own.

Alexander grew up in Jamaica playing the piano and the accordion, and he was versed in the up-and-coming popular music of the island.

"When I left Jamaica for the first time in the early '60s, there was no such name [as reggae]," Alexander says in an interview with All Things Considered host Audie Cornish. "And they had just begun to label that other music ska, Jamaica ska, and I was one of the musicians playing on those early recordings. I was about 15 years old."

After moving to the U.S., Alexander found success on the jazz club scene, playing with several heavyweight artists on his way up. In his quest to fit in, Alexander says his calypso roots took a back seat for the early portion of his career.

"When you come from another place and you have a chance to get in with the folks of whatever avenue you're going down ... you're trying to fit in, and in order to fit in, you have to leave your stuff behind," Alexander says.

After many years and visits back to his native Jamaica, Alexander began to incorporate sounds from his homeland into his music.

"I left the calypso and the island rhythms behind me, but they were always there in the back of my brain," Alexander says. "And years and years go by, and then I started to go back to Jamaica more frequently, and I realized how much I really loved home, and I started to bring back the roots rhythms."

The result was a multifaceted sound that eludes genre categorization and, consequently, a name.

"Monty Alexander music, that's all I can come up with," he says. "I have so many different directions that I can go in and make something out of it that I'm constantly being motivated by that. So my music is alive, it's right now, it's here and now. That's it."                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0279119-4a38099303d1621a7618ef05fbb94cc0.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005504 00000000000 014755  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Redpoint

The iPhone and iPad are truly elegant designs, but they are the rare exceptions in the rather drab world of consumer electronics. Most cameras, printers, computers, home theater receivers, and speakers are pretty sedate, but there is one product category that stands out: turntables. I've picked a choice selection that represents remarkable achievements in industrial design, and they're highly functional, exquisitely engineered products.

The Redpoint Model A turntable has an aluminum and composite Teflon platter, damped by silicone oil, and the turntable features a battery-powered 12-volt DC motor with precious metal brushes. The turntable weighs 90 pounds.

Positive Feedback

The Bergmann Magne turntable's "air" bearing allows the platter to float on a thin cushion of air. Magne means "strength" in Nordic mythology.

DaVinci

The DaVinci Monument AAS Gabriel turntable is available in automotive car color finishes, from the likes of Aston-Martin, Bentley, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Jaguar, and Porsche.

Continuum

The Continuum Copperhead isn't a turntable; it's a radically designed tonearm, named after a rare, highly venomous Australian snake. The arm "wand" is eggshell thin, shaped with special contours and compound curves to minimize the resonance of the arm.

AMG

Precision engineering and classic design are embodied in the first turntable from AMG (Analog Manufaktur Germany), the Viella 12. The AMG turntable was created by Werner Roeschlau, who works with his son and other master machinists at their Bavarian factory located north of Munich.

Thorens

In 1883, the Thorens family business was first registered in Sainte-Croix (Ste-Croix), Vaud, Switzerland by Hermann Thorens. They originally manufactured musical boxes and clock movements, and started producing Edison-type phonographs in 1903. The Thorens TD 2035 turntable is just the latest example of the company's long tradition.

Rega

The Rega RP6 is a classic British take on what a turntable should be. Rega is known for its excellent build quality, reliability, ease of use, and great sound.

Steve Guttenberg

The VPI Classic turntable and tonearm are made in New Jersey. It's a no-fuss, super-easy-to-use design, built to last practically forever.

Thorens

The belt-drive Thorens TD 550 features a suspended chassis, and the turntable is large enough to be used with 12-inch tonearms, which are preferred by vinyl devotees.

Unison Research

The Unison Research Giro belt-drive turntable features a "resonance optimized" chassis that uses acrylic and three layers of cherry wood.

The orange Tabby and gray Miniature Schnauzer had been living as strays on the street until two weeks ago, when they were rescued and brought to Chula Vista Animal Care Facility in Chula Vista, California, according to Amanda Mills, an administrator at the shelter.

A Good Samaritan had found the pair "hiding under a car together and cuddling," Mills told ABC News today. "And when they were brought in together, they immediately showed they didn't want to be separated, and they physically tried to stay together."

Normally, cats and dogs live in separate sections of an animal shelter -- and Romeo and Juliet did so at first, Mills said. But it soon became clear the "two were lovesick when away from each other."







"When the dog was out in the kennel, the cat just really wasn't doing very well," Mills said. "Romeo got kind of sick, pretty depressed. He wasn't eating well, and he was lethargic and didn't want to play. Even his coat and fur weren't in good condition."

To prevent a Shakespearean tragedy, the shelter staff "moved some things around" to create a special enclosure for Romeo and Juliet.

"They just needed to be together," Mills said. "As soon as Romeo saw Juliet again, he just perked right up. The cat finally started playing and eating again."







The shelter is now hoping that a family will soon adopt the duo, but only as a two-in-one package, according to Mills.

"They are very clearly bonded, which is very unusual," she said. "We've had two dogs bonded or two cats, but never a dog and a cat. It's definitely a first for our shelter, and we're very glad to have them here."                 0279382-a4988c124a06634f8a34bac75c7e7fd8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006153 00000000000 015142  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        High fructose corn syrup is a killer. Since humans started consuming it, obesity rates have more than tripled and diabetes incidence has increased more than seven fold. Even when used in moderation it is a major cause of heart disease, obesity, cancer, dementia, liver failure, tooth decay, and more.

So what does the FDA do about this silent killer? It allows food producers to change the name of the infamous sweeter in order to trick consumers into thinking they are not eating high fructose corn syrup.

That’s right, high fructose corn syrup now goes by a new, deceitful name – “Natural Sweetener” – designed to trick customers into making ill-informed choices that will impact on their health.

Consumers are finally catching on to the fact that what we put in our mouths effects our waistline as well as our health. Since consumers have become much smarter and finally waking up to these realities, they are demanding healthier food choices. Every food company is smearing 100% natural on every box of anything regardless of whats inside the box.

Now we have to know the new sneaky name to know whether or not we are consuming High Fructose Corn Syrup or not. Obviously the best way to avoid this mess is to buy from companies you really trust.

Big food companies are hiding ingredients they know we really don’t want to consume in their products. This time it’s the presence of a new version of high fructose corn syrup. But this is not the innocuous fructose that has sweetened the fruits humans have eaten since time began. This is a questionable ingredient with many names that could be causing all sorts of health problems.

The product is General Mills’ Vanilla Chex, an updated version of the Chex cereal sold in most conventional grocery and discount stores for many years. The front of the box clearly states that the product contains “no high fructose corn syrup” (HFCS), but turn it over to read the ingredient list and there it is – the new isolated fructose.

Why is that a problem? According to the Corn Refiners Association (CRA), there’s been a sneaky name change. The term ‘fructose’ is now being used to denote a product that was previously known as HFCS-90, meaning it is 90 percent pure fructose. Compare this to what is termed ‘regular’ HFCS, which contains either 42 or 55 percent fructose, and you will know why General Mills is so eager to keep you in the dark.

CRA explains:

“A third product, HFCS-90, is sometimes used in natural and ‘light’ foods, where very little is needed to provide sweetness. Syrups with 90% fructose will not state high fructose corn syrup on the label [anymore], they will state ‘fructose’ or ‘fructose syrup’.”

And the way that they get away with this is fairly simple:

“Simply eliminating the high fructose corn syrup designation for the laboratory sweetener that’s nine-tenths fructose and calling it what it really is: fructose. And that’s how a processed-food product like Vanilla Chex that contains “fructose”, a substance that, according to the corn refiners, used to be called HFCS-90, can now declare itself to be high fructose corn syrup-free.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279414-1935a21983f6ff484408a7d6eea82310.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002745 00000000000 014716  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        PlayStation 4 is just three weeks away from launch and the hype surrounding the console is never-ending. Trophies for many PlayStation 4 titles have already started syncing with the PlayStation Network. Trophies are a reward for the gamer, a pat on the back you can say, for their progress in the game. The difficulty of trophies varies from game to game, the higher the difficulty to achieve a trophy, the higher the value of the trophy earned. Curious to see how the trophy unlock notification looks like on the PlayStation 4 when compared to PlayStation 3?

With the PlayStation 4, the trophy unlock notification has seen major overhaul. This time, the trophy unlock notification appears from the top left side of the screen as opposed to the trophy unlock notification, which appeared on the top right side of the screen, on the PlayStation 3. Not only that but this time the effect for the trophy unlock notification on the PlayStation 4 is “slide and fade”. The notification “slides” in from the top left side of the screen and fades at the end while on the PlayStation 3, the trophy unlock notification was like a rounded rectangle bubble which didn’t have subtle fade in/out effect. And yes the iconic “ding” is present with PlayStation 4 trophy unlock notifications.

But one problem with this is that there is no agreement on what “extremism” is, let alone its causes or solutions.

The question of what constitutes a terrorist has always been contentious; the definition of “extremism” is even more so. Just as countries around the world leapt to label their dissidents terrorists after 9/11, the UK’s growing emphasis on “nonviolent extremism” is ripe for exploitation by authoritarian governments.

Britain has gone further than most countries in defining extremism specifically as a problem of undesirable beliefs. When the coalition government came to power in 2010, it revised the Prevent strategy to define extremism as “vocal or active opposition to fundamental British values” including democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and tolerance of different faiths and beliefs.

This change in policy was partly a reaction against some of the counter-terrorism work done by the previous Labour government in conjunction with Muslim faith groups. Critics claimed some of the faith groups that had been selected actually contributed to underlying problems of intolerance and division, because they reinforced the idea of separation between Muslim and other British communities. Moreover the new definition of nonviolent extremism was intended to be wider than Islamist groups, and to include the far right.

The definition, however, is not based on any clear theoretical or practical link to violence. Clearly, “nonviolent extremists” don’t have to be in favour of violence. The latest counter-extremism strategy, from 2015, states that extremist ideology is the core problem, with terrorism merely a symptom. By contrast, the research on terrorism, radicalisation and extremism suggests that, though beliefs matter to people and organisations who adopt violence, a more complex mix of social, psychological, political and strategic factors plays a part.

The idea of “non-violent extremism” has critics ranging from academics defending freedom of thought – such as Oxford University’s vice-chancellor this week – to police officers questioning how this concept could realistically be controlled.

But much less attention has been paid to the fact that Britain is also exporting its definition. Few people have analysed the implications for foreign policy of the UK promoting this concept of “non-violent extremism” among its global allies, through training programmes as well as high-level security dialogues. The concept hasn’t caught on with most western democracies, which remain focused on countering violent extremism; but it has been warmly received by non-democratic states, including some in the Gulf, which favour the sort of broad definitions that tar nonviolent dissidents with the same brush as violent ones.

Paradoxically, the UK’s definition of extremism is intended to reinforce liberal democratic values. But this is lost in translation when non-democracies embrace it. They are not amending their definitions to promote liberal values: rather, they tend to see Britain’s approach as validating their view that it is legitimate to criminalise dissident beliefs as a threat to national security.

When it comes to counter-terrorism cooperation with the Middle East, there is a clear common interest in fighting a recognised, common threat such as Isis or al-Qaida. By contrast, the understandings of what constitutes “extremism” are so far apart that proponents of democratic change – or of liberal social values, such as the freedom to be an atheist or to advocate LGBT or abortion rights – are viewed as extremists in the Gulf context.

Nor are Gulf states themselves united over what extremism means. The UAE and Qatar have opposite views on whether the Muslim Brotherhood is an extremist organisation, while Saudi Arabia’s grand mufti says Iran’s leaders are not Muslims. By contrast, the UAE has made it illegal to declare other Muslims to be apostates, as it sees this “takfirism” as deeply interlinked with extremists.

The UK, keen to strengthen its counter-terrorism partnerships, seems content to gloss over these differences. But if we don’t deal with the consequences of our loose definitions, including human rights abuses and the stoking of popular discontent in response, we could be storing up problems that come back to haunt us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279413-804d79da98a14cf3878fb08a40a0e11e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002664 00000000000 015125  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Putting an end to the rumours surrounding Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's expulsion in wake of the Ram Rahim verdict flare-up, BJP sources have confirmed that Khattar stays put.

In a meeting chaired by Amit Shah with BJP general secretary (Haryana) Dr Anil Jain and senior leader Kailash Vijaivargiya, it has been decided that Khattar will not be summoned to Delhi either- for any clarifications.

On the violence that engulfed parts of Haryana, Amit Shah said, "Keeping in mind the significance of Dera, the violence is handled well."

This comes amid reports that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP National President Amit Shah met on the intervening night of Saturday to take a call on Khattar's chief ministerial journey.

Earlier in the day, the Punjab and Haryana High Court hit out at the Chief Minister for allowing the state to burn for political gains.

Khattar is believed to have had good relations with Gurmeet Ram Rahim. Before Khattar became the Chief Minister in 2014, Rahim had openly rooted for him and promised him support from Dera followers.

Unemployment is nearly 26%, youth unemployment over 55%. The government is mired in a corruption scandal. The economy is grinding to a halt. On January 23, the Catalan assembly declared that the region constituted a "sovereign political and legal entity." A step closer to secession.

And then a general gave a speech.

It's just now percolating to the surface, but it happened on February 6, according to people who attended a conference on the Armed Forces and the Constitution at the Gran Peña, a club in Madrid that is a favorite hangout for retired military officers.

The discussion was moderated by José Antonio Fernández Rodera, editor of the military's magazine, Revista Jurídica Militar. Among the speakers were Ángel Calderón, Chief Justice of the Military Chamber; Pedro González-Trevijano, Chancellor of the King Juan Carlos University; and General Juan Antonio Chicharro, until 2010 commander of the Marine Corps and now in the reserves. About 100 people were in the audience.

There was nothing unusual until General Chicharro spoke. From the outset, he made clear that this wasn't an impromptu speech. According to various attendees, he apologized; he would have declined the invitation to speak, he said, but the current "separatist-secessionist offensive" in Catalonia obligated him to come forward.

In the armed forces, "there is a general feeling of preoccupation, fear, uncertainty, and confusion" on this topic, he said. He lamented the dismissal of General José Mena in 2006 after he'd publicly suggested that military intervention might be needed to counter Catalonia's demands for increased autonomy.

He criticized Catalan separatists for their distorted interpretation of the Constitution with regards to secession and offered his own interpretation of two articles: Article 8.1, which charged the Armed Forces with defending Spain and its territorial integrity; and Article 97, which spelled out the subordination of the military to the civilian government. The first was at the hard core of the Constitution, he said. The second was further removed, with less force.

And so, while using conditionals and turning statements into questions, he spun a theory on when the military would be justified in overthrowing the government. The problem would occur, he said, "if those responsible for the defense of the Constitution didn't behave as their role required."

He asked his listeners to imagine what would happen if the Popular Party (PP) were to lose its absolute majority in the next general elections, and the Catalan nationalists were to demand, in exchange for their support, a change of the Constitution to undo the doctrine of the "indissoluble unity" of Spain.

"So what do the Armed Forces do?" he wondered, but gave no answer. "The rules are one thing, practice is another," he said enigmatically. "If the defense mechanism of the constitutional order doesn't work, by act or omission, then...." He didn't complete the sentence. "The country is more important than democracy," he said. "Patriotism is a feeling, and the Constitution is nothing but a law."

Rousing applause, a standing ovation, cries of "Bravo! Bravo!" The questions from the audience went even further than the General's speech—until chancellor González-Trevijano cut them off: "The alternative to the constitution is collective suicide," he said.

When the story began to leak out, Diego López Garrido, the Socialist spokesman in Parliament on defense issues, pressed the Ministry of Defense to take immediate action against the general; he was still subject to the military disciplinary code which frowned upon suggesting coup d'états—in public. And on Thursday, the Ministry said that it has opened a preliminary inquiry to determine what exactly the general had said and if it ran afoul of any laws.

Perhaps warned by the general, the government is taking the hardest possible line against Catalonia's ambitions to secede. On Thursday, the State Council issued an opinion indicating that there were sufficient legal grounds to dispute the declaration by the Catalan assembly. On Friday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that the government would roll out its biggest legal gun. It would take the declaration to the Constitutional Court on the grounds that it violated the Constitution.

The economic nightmare with too many out-of-work restless young people on the streets, the secession of a region, a constitutional crisis in the wings, and dark rumblings by generals combine into a volatile mix. What had started out as a housing bubble that turned into a debt crisis then a broad economic crisis has morphed beyond the economy. It's gnawing on democracy.

Now, a political espionage scandal blew up—in Catalonia of all places—scattering debris and money laundering allegations far and wide. Read..... A Vast Political Espionage Scandal To Top Off The Sordid Corruption Scandal In Spain.                                                                                                                                                0279427-a457002736e8d78bc18e5e96cd137989.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000020147 00000000000 014740  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The attacking wonderkids are coming out of every corner of Asia. With their quick feet, great work rates and discipline, you can’t really go wrong when you, as a scout, are hunting for new talent.

Lee Seung Woo is a prime example. With his speed, technical ability, eye for goal, light touch in and around the box, and positive nature on and off the pitch, he is arguably the biggest prospect in Barcelona’s cantera. BarçaTV journalist Jaume Marcet describes him as “a striker with a midfielder’s soul."

In October 2010, when Lee was 12, a Barça scout spotted him in South Korea, during the 9-a-side mini World Cup. What stood out was his speed, dribbling and the ability to bag goal after goal.

The Barcelona scout had to set Lee up for a move to La Masia quickly, because Real Madrid and a couple of Bundesliga clubs were also interested. Fortunately, Lee chose the Catalans.

Back in Korea, Lee was a massive star in under-13 and 15 football. He managed to score 29 goals in 16 matches in the West Seoul Division, 11 goals in 6 matches during the knockout stages and was subsequently awarded the Cha Boom’s Youth Player MVP of the Year. With the U-15 side, he scored 38 goals and made 18 assists in just 29 games.

Similarities with Messi

Putting this into perspective, Lionel Messi scored 37 goals in 30 appearances at a similar age. No wonder people have given Lee the nickname: “The Korean Messi."

In truth, Lee's playing style isn’t that similar to Messi’s, but his ability to score goals is at a similar age, the same as Messi’s. Lee is a huge fan of Messi and when asked an opinion of the Barça superstar, he said:

“I watch Messi very closely. I want to be a perfect player just like him. My goal is to try my absolute best to become the first Korean to play for Barcelona’s senior team.”

Like Messi, Lee starts from the striker position and always drops back to receive the ball from his teammates, linking up with them and driving the ball forward with his exceptional dribbling and close control. In that sense, Lee and Messi are definitely similar. The same goes for their goalscoring records.

FIFA Suspension

In March 2013, Lee and a few other internationals were banned by FIFA from participating in official competitions for the club after complaints from an “unnamed club” (some rumors say that it was Real Madrid), in violation of Article 19 of the FIFA bylaws that relate to international footballers under the age of 18.

“The rules for the signing of minors are very clear. The popularity of football also brings some dangers. The financial success of our sport makes it, unfortunately, of interest to international mafias, who get rich due to illicit activities like match-fixing or tricking underprivileged kids with false promises of a professional career in Europe," FIFA President Sepp Blatter said.

In their defense, FC Barcelona officials pointed out that it was the Korean FA that offered Lee and two other footballers, Seung-Ho Paik and Gyeol-Hee Jang, to the club. These players will continue to train with the club and take part in friendlies until the end of the ban, in January 2016.

To add more controversy, Catalan paper Sport is reporting that cases like these are rare, as FIFA hardly interferes in such affairs, unless a complaint or allegation from another body or club is received. When a player like Lee performs as he has done ever since coming to La Masia, it’s not hard to see why other clubs would want to potentially eliminate the South Korean’s opportunity to grow and integrate into the Barcelona system, thus reducing the chances for him to succeed. This is, however, speculation and should therefore be taken with a grain of salt.

The star of his generation

Ever since he joined La Masia, Lee has been a big success. In his first tournament with Barça in the summer of 2011, Lee scored 13 goals in 10 games and was chosen as the MVP of the Torneo de Canillas.

In May 2012, Mundo Deportivo wrote a small article on him, stating that: “(A) 14-year-old is the star of Infantil A,” saying Lee is more than a goalscorer, despite 36 goals in 26 games, including five hat-tricks, and that he is known for excellent speed, intelligence of movement (with and without the ball) and stands out as a prototypical La Masia team mate.

Later that month his team played with the U-15 side, Infantil A, in the Lennart Johansson Trophy and won the competition, scoring 17 goals and conceding 0. Lee was top scorer. He impressed to say the least, scoring a brace in the semi-final against Dutch side Vitesse and then a goal in the final against Red Star Belgrade, which Barça won 2-0.

With the FIFA ban in place, Lee has been playing in many friendlies to keep in form. In October 2013, he scored a goal and an assist in the Copa Internacional del Caribe final.

Last year was a bit of a roller coaster for Lee. At the end of the 2013/14 season, the young South Korean was with the league-winning Juvenil B side, despite being eligible for Cadet A. Despite this achievement, he still wasn’t allowed to play any official matches at the club because of the ban imposed by FIFA.

During the summer, the ban was temporarily lifted while CAS was deliberating over the Barça appeal.

Lee was promoted to Juvenil A and played a couple of friendly tournaments with the team. These tournaments weren’t a success for the team and Lee had a tough time. He didn’t score any goals and his effect on the games were minimal. Meanwhile, CAS decided to extend the deadline for the final decision regarding Barcelona’s transfer ban, and the youngsters were once again suspended from playing any official matches for the Catalan club.

Star of the Asian Championship

Shortly after the pre-season came to an end, Lee went back to South Korea to prepare for the U-16 Asian Championship with the South Korean national team. Together with his Barcelona team mate Jang, also suspended by FIFA, they went on to become key players in South Korea’s run to the final.

Despite being suspended from the first game because of too many yellow cards during qualifiers, Lee went on to score two goals, both match-deciders, in the two group games he played. Both goals were created by Lee after some terrific individual brilliance.

On came the knockout stages. In the quarter-final against Japan, Lee scored both of the goals in South Korea’s 2–0 win. His second goal of the match was a rather easy one-touch goal but the first one was as good as a solo goal gets, and was one of the goals of the tournament.

Lee received the ball in his own half, sprinted past the midfielders, and dribbled past three out of four Japanese defenders before taking the ball past the helpless goalkeeper and putting it into the back of the net. One could say it was Maradona-Messi-esque.

The semi-final against Syria was a 7–1 thrashing and once again, Lee was the main man. He scored a penalty and made four (!) assists. In the final against North Korea, Lee was physically beaten by the hard-hitting defenders who did nott give the spaces Lee would have hoped for. In the end North Korea won 1–0, but despite a rather disappointing final, Lee was awarded MVP of the tournament. He was also the top goalscorer.

Since Lee already plays at a higher age level, at a much higher team level, these performances shouldn’t really come as the biggest surprise, but even so, Lee showed why he is one of the best talents in the world under the age of 18.

Economic Value

Economically, Lee can also become very important in the future. The Asian market is huge and if his development continues as it has, Barça will be able to use his marketing potential in Asia, especially South Korea, and earn enormous sums of money in a market that is only becoming more and more profitable. We saw this with Park Ji-sung when he was a key player for Manchester United.

Lee Seung Woo is definitely a player that we should keep an eye on for the future, but it is a very real fear that the ban, which has kept him away from official matches for two years now, might have had an effect on Lee’s development. However the talent is definitely there and hopefully, he will still develop into an important first-team player. He has the potential for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0279409-5df1007bde885bc125a98477a002453e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010233 00000000000 014754  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Supermarket acts following claims that it was using benefit claimants for unpaid labour via government programme

Tesco will offer paid placements with a guarantee of a job to all those people it will be taking on for work experience through a government scheme, after claims that it was using benefit claimants as unpaid labour led to a consumer backlash and in-store protests.

Tesco said the 1,500 unemployed people on jobcentre work experience schemes referred to the company over the next six months would now be given a choice of staying on benefits and completing the placement unpaid, or accepting a four-week paid placement with a guaranteed offer of a job at the end if the trial goes well.

Tesco said it was still signed up to the government's work experience scheme but would continue its dialogue with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to make sure the scheme was voluntary and that no jobseeker was penalised for withdrawing from it.

Currently access to the scheme is voluntary, but if participants leave without "good reason" after the first week, they can lose two weeks' jobseeker's allowance. A Tesco spokesperson described the negotiations with the government as "constructive".

The move comes as Superdrug and the electronics retailer Maplin, along with the mental health charity Mind, said they were withdrawing from the work experience programme and similar schemes.

A Tesco supermarket in central London was forced to close on Saturday after it was invaded by members of the Right to Work campaign protesting against a job advert looking for permanent workers in exchange for expenses and jobseeker's allowance only.

Campaigners from the group said they planned to hold protests on Wednesday at a number of Tesco stores, including two in London and one in Kingston upon Thames.

Richard Brasher, chief executive of Tesco UK, said: "We know it is difficult for young people to give up benefits for a short-term placement with no permanent job at the end of it. So this guarantee that a job will be available, provided the placement is completed satisfactorily, should be a major confidence boost for young people wanting to enter work on a permanent basis."

He added: "Tesco committed 3,000 work placements under the government's work experience scheme. To date around 1,500 have been delivered. We will offer the choice of paid work and the jobs guarantee to all of the remaining placements we will deliver under the scheme. Three hundred young people undertaking work experience with Tesco have already found work with us and we are confident that many more will through this approach."

The DWP does not think Tesco's improved offer will mean the supermarket takes on fewer unemployed people. On Monday, Iain Duncan-Smith, the work and pensions secretary, had defended Tesco, saying it was caught in the crossfire of an undignified row, but on Tuesday DWP ministers said they were relaxed about Tesco's decision.

Chris Grayling, the employment minister, has insisted that no one is forced on to the work experience scheme and that the use of penalties is limited.

Grayling said the scheme, aimed at 18- to 24-year-olds who are unemployed for more than three months, had been over-subscribed. "So far, half the people who go through the scheme come off benefits very quickly afterwards and many stay with the company with which they had work experience," he said.

However, it is not clear yet from government figures if those who have come off benefits have done so because they have found a job.

Officials figures show that more than 34,000 young people have been on the work experience scheme. A further 24,000 have been referred to the government's mandatory work activity scheme, which lasts for four weeks and is unpaid.

"No payment goes to any employer. They do it entirely at their own expense and any induction or training is an investment funded by the employer," Grayling said.

He accused some organisations targeting the scheme of pushing their own political agenda. "There seems to be a culture among some of the pressure groups that hate big companies. Do they really want young people to get no work experience? There should be no division about trying to tackle youth unemployment," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279330-db1be5d8d799f6ccfc6efe619a4a68ac.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007650 00000000000 015607  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Image courtesy of Vintage-Computer.com.

Psychologists talk about imprint memories, like how some of our older citizens remembered exactly where they were when President Kennedy was shot. I've been thinking about this whole Egypt thing and suddenly remembered where I was when Egypt's then President Sadat was assassinated.

I was a news junky even back then. I was in college, my junior year. On that day, I was in the Salisbury Laboratories of Worcester Polytechnic Institute and I remember seeing the reports on a TV. By the way, back in the first decade of the 20th century, this was also the building where rocket pioneer Robert Goddard would fire off test rockets in the basement, often sending professors and staff running for fire extinguishers! Fun place.

Anyway, Sadat was assassinated and Mubarak became President. The year before, I had been turning in my assignments on punch cards. Back then, we still used them in Fortran class. The Apple II was available for use in the Math Lab, and I was building a CP/M machine in my dorm room based on a relatively new Altair 8800.

Mubarak has been in office since the days of CP/M. He's been in office since before MS-DOS 1.0 was released.

Mubarak had been in office for three years when the original Macintosh came out, when Apple declared that 1984 wouldn't be like 1984.

Mubarak had been in office for four years when the original version of Windows was released in 1985.

Mubarak had been in office for seven years when Steve Jobs founded NeXT in 1988, his somewhat misguided attempt to sell computers to college students for the base price of $6,500.

Mubarak had been in office for eight years when the Intel 486 processor was released in 1989. If he were an American president, that's when he would have retired and gone on to a happy life of board memberships and speaking tours.

Mubarak had been in office for nine years when Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML, the concept of the URL, and the HTTP protocol in 1990.

Mubarak had been in office for ten years when Linus' first release of Linux hit the scene in 1991.

Mubarak had been in office for 13 years when Netscape was founded in 1994.

Mubarak had been in office for 17 years when Google was founded in 1998.

Mubarak had been in office for 23 years when Facebook was founded in 2004. Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg was only 21 at the time, having been born a few years after Mubarak took office.

Mubarak had been in office for 25 years when the first Twitter tweet was tweeted back in 2006.

Mubarak had been in office for 26 years when the first iPhone was released in 2007.

And, Mubarak has been in office for almost 30 years now, in 2011. Facebook has more than 600 million active users -- almost eight times the entire population of Egypt.

It's curious, when you think of the current crisis in Egypt in these terms. Would someone younger -- someone who didn't get his current job back in the days of CP/M -- would that someone have better realized just how self-destructive it would be to cut his nation off from the Internet?

Let's be clear about this: Mubarak took office two years before the founder of Facebook, the company causing the bulk of the disruption in his country, had even been born.

Because, without a doubt, Mubarak's actions are more destructive to his nation than anything else. The economic impact, alone -- not to mention the complete destruction of trust -- will have a lasting impact on Egypt.

Most citizens of the world hold Egypt in our hearts as one of the world's oldest and greatest civilizations. This week, we saw the old guard fight back against the disruption enabled by new technology.

But Internet technology cannot be squelched. It's now part of the DNA that runs our world. Mubarak may have been able to turn the Internet off in Egypt temporarily, but he will soon learn that a network designed to route around nuclear destruction will make short work of a leader who took office back in the days of 8-inch floppy disks.

This is the week, I think, when liberals start pushing it independently of that. It’s time to go on offense, if only to distract from the fact that IRS employees have begun to point fingers. Now that an appropriate period of respectful pretend-concern about Scandalmania has passed, they can resume following their standard messaging that all Democratic failure are ultimately caused by, or at least overshadowed by, larger Republican ones.

I saw Chris Cillizza’s item about overreach early this morning plus a couple of lefty random blog posts along the same lines and tweeted half-jokingly that the Meme Of The Week had already been set bright and early on Monday morning. I didn’t know the half of it:

Follow Karl’s links — especially the first one, where you’ll find this DNC memo from Friday entitled — ta da — “Memo: The Month of GOP Overreach.” David Plouffe, always ahead of the curve, tweeted the same point vis-a-vis Benghazi last week; Cillizza noted in his post that Plouffe also touched on it yesterday on ABC. Ron Fournier has a new piece up about overreach at today’s National Journal and this NYT piece, contrasting the GOP pursuit of scandal with the noble Democratic goal of legislation (specifically, the Gang of Eight’s terrible amnesty legislation), has whiffs of it. Even MSNBC Republican Michael Steele is chipping in. Here’s lefty Greg Sargent, observing/encouraging a “media backlash” in action:

Again: The goal of Issa and others here is to create an atmosphere of scandal, with the deliberate aim of obscuring the importance of the details of the actual scandals themselves (as Rep. Mike Rogers has now helpfully revealed). But there does seem to be a real media effort underway in some quarters to point out that that the smoke coming from the GOP smoke machine doesn’t mean there’s necessarily any fire there. That’s a far sight better than the 1990s, when scores of reporters would eagerly clamber aboard their shiny red fire truck to chase even the thinnest wisp of smoke whenever Republicans told them to.

Some people on Twitter are trying to draw a straight line from Friday’s DNC memo to today’s overreachapalooza but I’m skeptical. Why assume that like-minded reporters need written prompting from the DNC to start pushing this? They’re liberals exasperated by a flurry of scandals on a Democratic president’s watch; they’ll start whining about Republican “overreach” eventually whether they’re lobbied to do so or not. Frankly, I doubt even sympathetic media people pay attention to the parties’ dreary official talking points. If anything they’ve read has inspired them to push this, it’s more likely to be the lefty blogs they consume than some party apparatchik’s meme memo. Plus, don’t underestimate their personal pique at Issa for being the Republican face of oversight. His crack yesterday about Carney being a “paid liar” plus Plouffe’s roundhouse about Issa being some sort of car thief and suspected arsonist (both groundless) was probably all the urging that was needed to move this week’s political-media conventional wisdom from “the IRS behaved inappropriately” to “Issa and the GOP are out of control.” As Cillizza noted, to his credit, polls show that the public doesn’t agree. But give these guys time; they’re just getting started.

Update: Via Newsbusters, a textbook example of what I’m talking about. Wish I’d seen it when I was writing the post. AG Conservative notes that it’s the same nonsense the media pulled after Benghazi, grumbling about Romney’s statement on the attack as a way of not covering the attack itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0279049-68b69c8dd6bd65a2b24b86963def55d3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000047136 00000000000 015242  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        This is the second edition of the VainRank Glossary of Vainglory terms and vocabulary. This is the slang that you will hear in in-game communication with others and may not understand put together by several players who have played the game since the beginning and provided to the new and old players alike to make sure we are all on the same page. We plan to update this in the future as new words develop in the community. For now, these are the words we feel most players are getting confused on and don’t understand.

The Vainglory Glossary has LEVELED UP! This is the version 2.0 of the Vainglory Glossary and covers an even bigger array of terms.

If you like this Vainglory Glossary, make sure to checkout the videos created by Gankstars explaining more in depth about many of these terms in their Gankstars Academy

Assassin: A typically squishy hero with low defensive stats but high damage and ability stats. Mainly targets the high damage heroes on the enemy team, or target heroes below half health as they are usually the easiest to take out.

Broken: A hero that is viewed as so overpowered that their are no counters for them. They are also seen to have no way of losing even if the player playing them is totally new to the game. Often times, when a hero is “broken” they will get titles to reflect it (i.e. Brokenfeather).

Fortified Health: Health that takes twice as much damage to penetrate than regular health. 100 fortified health is equivalent to 200 health.

Glass Cannon: An item build in which no defense is involved. Only offense items are in this build, typically on CP mages.

Utility: A type of item or ability that provides an effect to help the team.

Warrior: A hero who has high base defensive stats and is very effective in melee combat.

Creature Terms

Many people have different ways of referring to the minions and their locations. These are the most common references to the positions with which they hold and what they do.

CS: Creep score, the number of lane or jungle minions that were last hit by you. This is counted by the amount of gold the minion was worth, so the bigger lane minions count as two CS, for example.

Farm: The action of focusing on increasing CS.

Backs: The two jungle camps on each side behind the minion mines and in front of the base. The minion camp with two big minions is often referred to as the “doubles.”

Fronts: The minion camps right next to the shop on each side with two small minions.

Gold mine: The creature in the pit that is spawned from 4:00-15:00 minutes and collects gold over time. Killing the gold mine gives your team certain amounts of gold (gold per team member). The amount of gold gained is based off of how long it’s been since the gold mine was last killed.

Healer camps/medics: The two camps on each side of the jungle that give you heals. If you have used the number system in terms of numbering the minion camps, they would be camps 1 and 3. Sometimes referred to as back heal or front heal.

Jungle camp number system: Often used to make messaging easier, but rarely used in voice comms in game. The heal minion camp you first encounter when you go into the jungle from your base is camp number 1. The backs/doubles behind the minion mine is camp number 2. The heal minion next to your tri-bush is camp number 3. And you guessed it! The front camp is minion camp number 4.

Spawn: When minions appear (either jungle monsters or lane minions).



Tri-bush: The bush that looks like a triangle on both sides of the gold miner pit/kraken pit.

Wave: A minion wave is the group of four minions that spawn every 20-30 seconds (will get accurate spawn timer tonight)

Objectives

Traps: Traps usually refer to the item you can buy called scout traps. Sometimes abilities such as Kestrel’s Active Camo are referred to as a traps as well.

Mines : Mines are Minion Mines and Gold Mines. Often times, people confuse the word “mines” with scout traps because a lot of people call them mines.

Kraken: Helga! The monster who emerges from the pit at 15 minutes and usually take 2-3 team members to unleash. Once beaten into submission this monster fights the enemy’s turrets for your team until it falls.

Turrets: The structures on each side of the Halcyon Fold defending the Vain crystal. You must destroy these to make it to the enemy Vain.

Vain crystal: The Vain crystal is the main objective of the game. Once you destroy the enemy Vain crystal being defended by 5 turrets on each side, you win the game!

Maneuvering and Skill Terms

Bait: When a character puts themselves in a vulnerable position trying to lure out the enemy team while the rest of the team waits hidden so that they can ambush the enemies.

Face-Check: To go into a bush blindly, without knowing if anyone is there or not.

Hitbox: A radius or range an ability can hit.

Leashing: The act of bringing a jungle camp to its farthest range away from the camp. Commonly used as a roamer to help give your jungler ambient gold and experience.

Juke: To dodge a skillshot or to fake out an enemy hero using a bush or quick movement to the side, causing the ability to miss the hero.

Kiting: The act of attacking and stepping back repeatedly to keep the enemy chasing you but not able to hit you while you deal the damage. Usually used with ranged heroes against melee heroes.

Peel: To protect your teammates by using an ability or an item to maintain a safe distance for allies from an enemy.

Pull: When a hero is able to pull the opposing heroes closer to them. Usually this is done with Phinn’s ultimate which uses his hook to pull the opposing team closer.

Proc: Activating a passive of an item. For example, the passive damage boost of a Tension Bow is procced every six seconds.

Repositioning: The act of using an ability like Vox’s Sonic Zoom to put yourself in a better position for fights or farming.

Root: A root causes a hero to become stuck, not allowing the hero to move or use dash abilities. However, the hero can still basic attack, use non-dash abilities, and use active items.

Skill shot: An ability that requires firing in a target direction or placing an ability at a targeted area. Maximizing the effect of skill shots requires predicting the enemy’s movements.

Splash Damage/AOE: Splash damage is damage that affects not only the target, but also surrounding enemies in a given radius. AOE stands for area of effect, damage/heals/crowd control in a given radius (ex. Lyra’s A and B).

Stutter-stepping: The act of moving and attacking to attack faster. The increased 18% attack speed when done correctly leads to a higher amount of damage per second. Often helps to take less damage and dodge skill shots.

Item Building

Crystal Power (CP): The attribute of an item that focuses on the abilities of a hero. Crystal power items are identified easily by their blue background. Some items are of another type but have crystal power effects. Contraption, for example, is a utility item that lowers the cooldown on your abilites, which is a crystal attribute.

Hybrid: An item build that includes WP and CP items. Generally not effective, with one notable exception in TB/Stormcrown/AS Taka.

Utility Item: These items usually have a purple background and are meant for protection and vision. They have a wide range of effects and are usually bought by the roamer.

Weapon Power (WP): An item attribute that emphasizes damage based on the hero’s auto attacks. These items are easily distinguished by their red background. Like crystal power, this power can be found in other types of items. Alternating Current, for example, requires weapon speed to build it.

Item Effects

Active: Active items have a special effect that must be timed well to get the most benefit out of, such as Fountain or Crucible.

Cleave: Damage done in a certain arc and a certain radius.

Cooldown: The amount of cooldown on an item or ability… how long you have to wait before using it again.

Cooldown Ratio (CDR): A ratio that affects your cooldown.

Critical Chance: The % chance you have of landing a critical strike. You can increase critical chance by building Tyrant’s Monocle and Tornado Trigger.



Critical Strike: A critical hit, which deals a % of extra damage on your basic attack.

Buffs: Team-wide items, “selfish items,” or abilities that gives you a buff on yourself or other team members. Ex. Breaking Point (weapon damage buff for yourself), Broken Myth (crystal damage buff for yourself), Fountain of Renewal (Team-wide health buff), Adagio’s Gift of Fire (target hero heal).

Debuffs: Team-wide items, “selfish items,” or abilities that gives you, your team or your enemies a weakness in a stat (i.e. Bonesaw uses its stacks to weaken the opponents armor).

Lifesteal: Health you gain back by doing a certain type of damage. Serpents mask gives 10% WP lifesteal, you gain 10% of the damage you deal as health.

Maimed: Means you had Atlas applied to you which lowers attack speed.

Mortal Wound: A debuff that affects healing you can get from items and passive heal/sec. Sometimes has a dps amount as well. Fortress and Taka can inflict mortal wounds.



Passive: The effect of an item that always takes place, no need to activate it.

Pierce: Damage with pierce ignores a percentage of shield. 10% shield pierce on Broken Myth makes all crystal damage ignore 10% of the enemy’s shield.

Stacks: A passive part of an item that gives you buffs, or gives enemies debuffs. Breaking Point stacks give you a damage buff, increasing in damage with the more stacks you have. Bonesaw gives the enemy you attack a debuff in armor, shredding more armor with the more stacks you have on that hero.

Shredding: This is very similar to stacks, but instead of buffing it debuffs your opponents armor, weakening it so that you deal more weapon damage.

Snared: Snares make it so you cannot use dash abilities and can apply a decaying slow as well.

Stunned: Stuns make it do you can not move or use any items or abilities except for Reflex Block.

True Damage: Damage not affected by armor and shield.

Vision: A scout trap or flare, or to be able to see a place with a flare or scout trap outside of your team’s vision range.

In-Game Strategic Terms

These are things you may use in communication on what want to tell your teammates to do to get tactical advantages in the game.

Ace: To kill all of the heroes before one respawns, which heals the team, buffs the lane minions, and gives you temporary free rein of the map.

Babysit: For the roam to stay in lane to prevent ganks. Often happens when laner is behind or looking to push ahead.



Backdoor: The act of “secretly” going to the enemy Vain when the crystal is exposed. CP Kestrel, Taka, and anyone with a jump or long ranged dash are the best heroes to backdoor with.

Body block: The act of a teammate defending another to prevent the low health teammate from being killed by a skill shot.

CC: Crowd Control.

Collapse: The act of one team coordinating an attack on an enemy away from their team. For example, when enemy jungler solo invades your jungle, your team can collapse together on that jungler to overwhelm them.

Countergank: If the enemy team ganks your laner you can quickly gank the other laner because they often will overextend after your laner dies.

Dash: An ability that gives you a given movement radius. Glaive’s Afterburn and Vox’s Sonic Zoom are two examples of dashes.

Engage: The act of one hero targeting another hero in battle. This can be to begin the fight or deciding if the hero should leave the battle or stay and fight.

Feeding: When a player keeps dying over and over which allows the other team to unnecessarily get the gold and experience. Like a man getting fat off of eating too much, so these heroes get stronger off of experience and wealth that is freely given to them. When only one hero is getting the kills on the opposing team, that hero is referred to as being fed.

Focus: To have your whole team kill a specific hero; to focus a specific hero on an enemy team strategically to make the rest of the teamfight easier.

Freezing: The act of stopping the minions in a certain spot to make the enemy laner over-extend for farm or to make it harder for the enemy laner to get farm.

Gank: The act of ambushing the laner from the bottom lane bushes to get a kill or make the enemy laner back off the lane and even teleport back to base.

Group up: The act of having your whole team meet at a certain place on the map to set up an engagement for a team fight, or to have your whole team there for when the enemy team may engage on you.

Harass: The action of constantly placing pressure to a point that the enemy is longer able to farm. For example, Saw can harass most laners with his extremely high attack speed in the early game.

Initiate: To make the first move on the opposing team and commence the fight. Many teams use this to get the upper hand in the fight or to force a battle when they feel they have the tactical advantage or overall lead.

Invade: To have your jungler and your roamer or your whole team invade the enemy jungle for kills and enemy jungle farm. Effective when ahead in a game.

Last hit: The act of farming in the lane and gaining gold. When you last hit a lane minion, you get 40 or 80 gold (depending on which minion you last-hit), as well as a chunk of experience.

Overextend: The action of moving to a location where, if the enemy collapses, you would be too far out to come back alive.

Poke: The act of dealing damage to an enemy hero while being at a safe distance. Longer ranged skill shots are best for poking.

Proxy Farming: Killing lane minions before they meet your minions behind an enemy turret, allowing your minions to proceed straight to the turret so you farm and enemy loses minions to the turret.

Pushing: The act of clearing lane farm to make your minion wave push towards the enemy turret.

Siege: The action of placing pressure on a turret as a team while the other team is present to defend the turret.

Team Fight: A fight which includes both full teams; 3v3 fights.

TP(Teleport): The act of going back to base using the teleport/recall button.

Trade: When teams leave a battle having killed the same amount of heroes. For example, a 3 vs 3 begins and both teams get 1 kill and back off.

Turtling: When far behind in a match, you stay at base and your lane carry gets all of the lane farm as it comes towards your base. The jungler usually picks up more defense than usual to help protect the lane carry.

Unfreezing: The act of clearing all of your minions after freezing the lane to make the minions push and to give you a big gold boost.

Zoning: Using a skill shot ability to keep your opponents at a certain range.

Out of Game Strategy

Counterbuild: Countering means to build an item that counters another heroes’ kit in order to defeat them easier. Krul builds Shiversteel to help stick to his target to gain stacks. Celeste builds Broken Myth to pierce through the shield.

Counterpick (heroes): Based on abilities and basic attributes, there are heroes that can play more effectively against other heroes. When drafting, after the opposing team chooses a hero a player may choose to pick a hero that plays well against the opposing player’s hero. You can sometimes counter whole team strategies and certain player mechanics if you know them well enough.

Mechanics: The innate skill gained by a player over time and experience regarding the tiny differences in abilities, items, positioning etc…

Team Comp: Hero composition; The combination of heroes that make up or compose your team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0279228-35dd400b3ac52732f6b66874a36e1888.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000023007 00000000000 014707  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        {"id":1580704301098,"title":"We Bare Bears Blue Tiger Phone Case for Iphone and Galaxy","handle":"we-bare-bears-blue-tiger-phone-case-for-iphone-and-galaxy","truncated_description":"\u003cp\u003eHave the lucky tiger with you at all times !

Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said.

Republicans and their supporters have been bashing the individual mandate so loudly and so vociferously that it’s easy to forget this outrage is a relatively recent phenomenon. Not so long ago, it was easy to find GOP officials and conservative intellectuals who supported the mandate, and not simply because they thought it was the smart thing to do. They also thought it was the right thing to do. In fact, they were the ones who first put the idea on the political agenda.

The story of how Republicans first came to this conclusion and then abandoned it is a pretty good parable for how the GOP has changed in the last 30 years. It also says a lot about the people who will suffer as their efforts to unwind the Affordable Care Act go forward.

The Mandate Was A Conservative Idea Originally

Most historians trace the mandate back to a 1989 paper by Stuart Butler, who at the time was director of domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation. This was a different era, when influential conservative policy thinkers endorsed universal coverage, at least in principle, but wanted to avoid straightforward expansions of government programs or new requirements that employers pay for insurance.

Butler’s proposal envisioned a fine for people who did not get insurance, along with generous new subsidies to make coverage more affordable. And the two went together for a reason: “This requirement would imply a compact between the U.S. government and its citizens,” Butler explained. “In return for the government’s accepting an obligation to devise a market-based system guaranteeing access to care and protecting all families from financial distress due to the cost of an illness, each individual must agree to obtain a minimum level of protection.”

Butler also wanted to avoid a “free rider” problem. Bound by professional ethics and law (the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act), doctors and hospitals would almost always provide care to uninsured people who needed it, Butler knew. But they would also pass the costs of that care onto the rest of society in the form of higher charges for paying customers ― unless, because of a mandate, everybody had insurance.

“If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance,” Butler said. “If we find that he has spent his money on other things rather than insurance, we may be angry but we will not deny him services ― even if that means more prudent citizens end up paying the tab. ...Each household has the obligation, to the extent it is able, to avoid placing demands on society by protecting itself.”

Butler’s call for a health insurance requirement did not generate much of a response at the time. The reality is that not many Republicans were even thinking about the subject in the late 1980s. But that changed a few years later, after Bill Clinton became president and focused on health care as his big domestic policy priority. Desperate to show they had an alternative that would achieve the same basic goals, 20 Republican senators co-sponsored a bill that included an individual mandate.

That represented nearly half of the GOP’s Senate caucus, as Avik Roy, now president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, later noted in Forbes. Among those Republican co-sponsors were Charles Grassley of Iowa and Orrin Hatch of Utah, both of whom are still in the Senate today. And it made sense, too, because Butler’s argument emphasized individual responsibility, as Republicans frequently do.

Republicans ultimately succeeded in blocking Clintoncare, and when they did interest in GOP universal coverage plans vanished almost as quickly as they’d appeared. But years later, in Massachusetts, then-Governor Mitt Romney, also a Republican, decided the mandate should be part of his state’s initiative to make coverage universal. He cited the very same logic Butler had ― in part, perhaps, because he’d worked with Heritage on crafting his plan. “It’s the ultimate conservative idea, which is that people have responsibility for their own care, and they don’t look to government to take [care] of them if they can afford to take care of themselves,” Romney said in 2005.

By this time, Democrats were also embracing the mandate, partly because they understood it would encourage healthy people to enroll ― and partly because they hoped that, by trying to pass a system with conservative elements, they could help secure Republican support for universal coverage in the future. For a short while it looked like the gambit might work. In 2009, as Congress was writing what would become the Affordable Care Act, Grassley told Fox News: “Everybody has some health insurance costs, and if you aren’t insured, there’s no free lunch, somebody else is paying for it. … I believe there is a bipartisan consensus to have an individual mandate.”

After Obama Embraced The Mandate, Republicans Rejected It

But then President Barack Obama, who had resisted calls for a full mandate during his presidential campaign, came around to the idea himself. And like everything else Obama touched, the idea became toxic on the right ― eventually attracting the ire of pretty much every leading Republican, including Hatch, who claimed he reconsidered after thinking through the constitutional issues.

A lawsuit challenging the mandate failed thanks to a narrow Supreme Court ruling in 2012, but Republicans never gave up their efforts to get rid of it. And now President Donald Trump has picked up the cause. If Congress won’t get rid of it through legislation, Trump has said, he will use his executive authority to undermine it.

So what explains the shift? For the likes of Hatch, motivated reasoning ― that is, adjusting policy beliefs to fit political situations ― seems like an obvious factor. As Ezra Klein observed in a 2012 New Yorker article, it’s simply not credible to think Republicans who spent two decades supporting or at least tolerating a policy suddenly decided, upon its enactment, that it violated the constitution. More likely, Republicans had committed themselves to opposing “Obamacare” no matter what (as subsequent reporting by journalists Steve Brill and Michael Grunwald confirmed) and these officials changed their positions.

But the ideological composition of the Republican Party has changed too, especially in the last few years. The logic of the mandate depends on a recognition that everybody will need health care at some point, because everybody can get sick or injured, and that society has some obligation to provide that care. That was Butler’s whole point ― and Romney and Grassley’s too.

These days it’s tough to find conservatives or Republicans willing to say the same thing. Not coincidentally, a common element in each Obamacare repeal proposal Republicans tried to pass this year was an effort to isolate people with serious medical problems, by undermining guarantees of coverage for pre-existing conditions. These bills also called for dramatic reductions in funding for insurance subsidies and for Medicaid. Had any of those measures become law, the financial burden for high medical bills would have fallen more squarely on the people who incur them, and less on society as a whole.

None of that is to say the mandate is sacrosanct or that serious people, particularly libertarians, can’t argue against it in good faith. The penalty really is a burden for some people, many of them lower- and middle-income. It’s also paternalistic, which is something that makes many conservatives genuinely uncomfortable. But it’s telling that, as these efforts to repeal the mandate move forward, only one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, is talking seriously about different policy mechanisms that could achieve the same basic goals of spreading the financial burden of illness and keeping a stable market for comprehensive coverage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279445-e0048c09cb6e933c93eb6344f7b62f71.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001450 00000000000 015051  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Boys In Blue: 1st Lt. Michael F Swartzcope, 31st Illinois Infantry, Company A

Michael F. Swartzcope of Illinois stood six-foot-five and a half and at 41 years of age he mustered into the 31st Illinois Infantry as a Private. Census records tell us that Michael worked as both a cooper and a surveyor before the war began. Over six foot tall and a surveyor…sound familiar? By the end of the war, Michael was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and Quartermaster. Michael’s Lincolnesque life continued after the war; Lincoln was a lawyer, and Swartzcope followed a law career as well, serving as a judge in Jackson County, IL from 1865 to 1869. Judge Swartzcope passed away on March 22, 1901 at the age of 80 at the Home for Disabled Veterans in Danville, IL.

But at least two of the gadgets presented to Chen as gifts may not have been quite what they seemed: They included software intended to spy on the blind dissident, according to Jerome Cohen, an NYU professor who has been Chen’s mentor, and another source familiar with the episode.

Like nearly everything surrounding Chen these days, the existence of the spyware is in dispute, and only adds to the public recriminations there have been between NYU and Chen’s supporters over events surrounding the end of his fellowship.

Last weekend, Chen accused NYU of bowing to pressure from China by ending the fellowship, and his supporters have suggested that the university is wary of displeasing the Chinese authorities because of its plans for a campus in Shanghai. The allegations are vigorously denied by NYU, which says the fellowship was only ever planned to last a year.

At issue in the latest escalation in the argument are an iPad and at least one of the smartphones that were given to Chen days after he fled China and arrived in Manhattan. The devices were found by NYU technicians to have been loaded with software that made it possible to track the dissident’s movements and communications, according to Cohen and the second source, who was not authorized to speak on the matter.

The episode suggests that from almost the day that he arrived at the university there was an uneasy atmosphere between Chen, his supporters, and NYU

Among the first visitors in May 2012 to the New York apartment Chen had moved into with his family after a dramatic escape from house arrest in China was Heidi Cai, the wife of activist Bob Fu. She brought an iPad and iPhone as gifts.

The devices were screened by NYU technicians within a few days and were found to have been loaded with hidden spying software, said Cohen, who arranged the fellowship for Chen at NYU Law School, helping defuse a diplomatic crisis between the United States and China after Chen took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.

“These people supposedly were out to help him and they give him a kind of Trojan horse that would have enabled them to monitor his communications secretly,” said Cohen.

The iPad was eventually cleaned up and returned to Chen at his request, the second source said.

The spyware issue was not publicized at the time and has only surfaced because of the recent scrutiny of NYU’s arrangement with Chen. Cohen said he was surprised when he heard that Reuters knew about the episode.

“007 THING”

Asked about the gadgets, Fu told Reuters that his wife had given two Apple devices to Chen shortly after the dissident had settled in New York. Fu runs a Christian group called ChinaAid that supports underground churches in China and victims of forced abortions.

“This is the first time I’ve heard of spyware,” said Fu, who was in southeast Asia when his wife delivered the devices. He called the allegations “ridiculous” and “like a 007 thing.”

“We knew that the first thing after they arrived, they’d want to call their family members, so we wanted to provide communication devices, iPhone and iPad,” Fu said by telephone from Texas.

Although Cohen and the second source say they were left with no doubt the devices were deliberately installed with spyware, it could not be established whether there might be a more innocent explanation for what technicians believed they had found. The technicians could not be reached for comment.

In examining the iPad and the iPhone, they found software that allowed a third party to secretly connect to an inbuilt global positioning system, essentially turning a device into a tracking device, said the second source. The technicians also found hidden, password-protected software that backed up the contents to a remote server, the source added.

“It’s perfectly consistent with their desire to manipulate and control the situation and know whatever confidential advice he is getting,” Cohen said.

SUSPICIOUS SOFTWARE

At least three other electronic devices, given to Chen and his wife during their first few days in New York by people other than Fu, also included suspicious software, the second source said.

Fu said he consulted ChinaAid’s computer technician on Thursday and “my staffer is 100 percent sure that the only thing he added on the iPad was a Skype account.”

His technician did only routine things like “the activation of the iPad and iPhone, basic installment, iCloud... there was nothing else there. They have to provide evidence,” said Fu.

“Everything was transparent. There was nothing hidden,” he added.

John Beckman, a spokesman for NYU, declined to discuss specifics about the episode. “I do remember hearing about it, I was never really aware of the details, and so I’m not going to comment on it,” he said.

Several of Chen’s supporters allege that NYU staff has controlled and withheld access to the activist. NYU rejects these claims and some figures connected with the university, including Cohen, say that some of Chen’s supporters may be trying to manipulate the self-trained lawyer who speaks little English to serve their own political ends.

Chen could not be reached for comment.

But Mark Corallo, a media consultant who has been working with Chen, said that the gifts from Fu were taken away by NYU before the dissident received them.

“The devices were brand-new when ChinaAid gave them to NYU to give to Chen, so there was no need or reason to perform any check,” he said in an email. “And none of these functions was on any of the devices provided to him by ChinaAid.”

He added that: “At least to Chen’s knowledge, none of these devices was ever found to have any tracking or listening mechanisms.”

Cohen and the second source maintain, however, that Chen was told within days of his arrival in an unfamiliar country that people he believed to be his supporters were very likely spying on him. Chen was “furious” and “very upset” when told, the second source recalled.

Even so, Cohen said Chen still continued to interact with the Fu family. “That’s his right,” Cohen said.                                                                                                              0279378-a8ddf46efff851e815030de82f9ff932.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007072 00000000000 015324  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called on President Obama to issue a “bold” executive order that would stop the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants, including farm workers, families of people allowed to remain in the country under the administration's “Dream Act” policy, and many others.

In an op-ed published by Univisión, Pelosi, along with Reps. Zoe Lofgren and Luis Gutiérrez, called on Obama to legalize immigrants who would have benefited from a comprehensive immigration reform bill the U.S. Senate passed in 2013.

The trio of lawmakers said the president should go even further by permitting close relatives of citizens and lawful permanent residents to gain entry into the United States, and blocking the deportation of relatives who are here illegally.

“Doing so would not permit family members to skip the line, but it would allow them to wait in line with their family until a visa number becomes available," the lawmakers wrote.

With less than a week to go before the pivotal midterm elections, Democrats are eager to bolster turnout among their base of Hispanic voters.

Party officials, however, fear that enthusiasm will be depressed among Hispanic voters because Obama has not yet taken promised executive action on deportations.

Obama recently announced he is postponing action until after the November election.

Democrats, meanwhile, are eager to implement provisions in the Senate-passed bill, despite GOP opposition.

The legislation included some Republican support in the Senate but was never considered in the GOP-led House. Many Republican lawmakers feared the bill would be too soft on border security, would raise unemployment and would stretch the limits of the nation’s social welfare system.

The measure would have increased visas for immigrant workers of all skill levels, created a guest worker program for immigrant farm hands and would have provided a pathway to citizenship for the millions of people now living in the United States illegally.

The president, the lawmakers wrote in the op-ed, could also order an end to deportations and easier re-entry into the United States, for families of young people granted legal status under Obama’s recent executive action known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which provides work permits, but not permanent legal status, for young people brought here illegally as children.

In the op-ed, Pelosi, Lofgren and Gutiérrez said that because the House refused to consider the legislation, Obama, “could use his authority to prevent family separation — this time of undocumented close family members of U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or DACA beneficiaries.”

They added, “Similarly, he could recognize that it is 'essential for agriculture' that farmworkers who toil in our fields do so without fear.”

Immigration activists are also pressuring Obama this week to end deportations through executive action.

Members of “United We Dream” gathered in front of the gates of the White House on Thursday morning to demand Obama act on his executive action promise.

“Any executive action to provide deportation relief that the president announces after the elections must include as many people as possible,” Carlos Rojas, an illegal immigrant who is a member of the group, said in a statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0279402-7042158b21cf0627743ea95d31d3d9f7.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011562 00000000000 014702  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Immigrants are solving a labor shortage as the number of people needing care, whether elderly or disabled, grows, according to the report.

The population is rapidly aging, unemployment is high, and millions of illegal workers in the U.S. are waiting to see how Congress will act on immigration reform.

At the intersection of those three very different topics is the question of who will continue to care for aging Americans. A new report says that immigrants, including many illegal workers, are staving off a labor shortage in this field, but those on the other side of the debate have a different view.

As of 2010, the most recent year for available data, there were 3.4 million U.S. direct care workers, according to the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute. Direct care workers include personal care attendants, nursing assistants, and other similar positions. That number is expected to increase to 4.3 million by 2018, driven in large part by at-home workers and personal care workers, which are both expected to grow by around 50 percent, according to a report from the Institute for Women's Policy Research. The report, which focuses on women in the direct care workforce, finds that immigrants make up 28 percent of all in-home healthcare workers, and that more than 20 percent of all immigrants employed in direct care are illegal.

The report concludes immigrants are solving a labor shortage, filling jobs that would otherwise go unfilled, a problem that will only get worse as the number of people needing care, whether elderly or disabled, grows.

"In the face of this labor shortage, a growing immigrant population in the United States has stepped up to fill a substantial portion of care work jobs," the authors write.

Because of the projected future need of care workers, IWPR's report puts forth four proposals that would help to keep immigrant care workers in the country, including providing a path to legalization for undocumented care workers, and implementing a provisional visa system that could help workers to transition to permanent visa status.

The goal is to keep those workers in the country and make their lives better, says one of the report's authors. Median weekly pay for all female in-home care workers is $308, compared with $560 for all U.S. female workers, and illegal immigrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation (such as lower pay) and abuse, according to the report.

"The wages for a range of reasons are kept low, and we do consider that a problem," says Jane Henrici, study director at IWPR. "We're concerned for the workers' sake that they be able to subsist on those salaries."

However, opponents of this type of reform say it's not just about the workers, it's about the jobs and the American workforce.

"The reason we are relying increasingly on foreign healthcare workers is not because Americans don't want to do these jobs; it's that wages and working conditions don't meet the expectation of American workers." says Ira Mehlman, media director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates heavier border security and generally tighter immigration policies.

He says the arguments parallel those about immigrant workers in other occupations, such as agricultural labor, where illegal immigrants are employed.

"We've created a lot of self-fulfilling prophecies, where we offer poor wages and poor working conditions, Americans don't take the jobs, and the employer turns around and says, 'We need all of these foreign workers to do the jobs,'" says Mehlman.

Henrici and Mehlman agree that illegal workers are often paid unjustifiably low wages. And while Mehlman might argue for Americans taking these in-home care jobs, and Henrici argues for legal status for workers, the outcome for people needing that care would be the same: a higher price. Mehlman claims that native-born or naturalized workers would likely require higher wages, while Henrici says that visas tend to increase workers' wage opportunities.

That means, depending on what sort of immigration reform Congress passes, people who become disabled, as well as aging Boomers who require at-home care, would have to shell out more money. A broad bipartisan framework unveiled earlier this year included a path to citizenship for people here illegally. However, exactly how that might look is still under debate.

Allowing people to do these in-home jobs illegally "short-circuits the whole need that people who are approaching that age really ought to be thinking about," says Mehlman. The answer, he says, is for people approaching retirement to either invest in long-term care insurance or "assume some level of personal responsibility" in terms of saving up for care that might be expensive.

Henrici says it's important to understand how widespread the need could soon become: "We want to avoid exploitation. That needs to be the emphasis. We all need these workers," she says.

For more than a decade the Raiders have been searching for and trying to develop a blocking tight end. Given the state of their offensive line, that’s become even more important.

David Ausberry was supposed to fit that role and is the team’s most accomplished blocker as a tight end, but the 2011 seventh-round draft pick has missed 26 games over the past two seasons because of injuries. He’s also coming off knee surgery.

Brian Leonhardt tried to fill the gap in 2014 but ended his season on injured reserve due to a concussion.

Oakland’s best tight end in terms of receiving is Mychal Rivera. Rivera has 96 receptions and eight touchdowns in two seasons and proved to be one of quarterback Derek Carr’s most reliable downfield threats in 2014. But while Rivera has improved as a blocker, the Raiders would prefer to find another option to free up Rivera more in the passing game.

Normally a blocking tight end wouldn’t be high on the priority list for any NFL team, but Oakland has struggled to run the ball with any kind of consistency and needed to keep its tight ends in to assist with the blocking. The results were mediocre at best.

That’s where Johnson will come in.

He was Detroit’s tight ends coach in 2013 before being moved to offensive line assistant when Jim Caldwell was hired as head coach.

The Lions did not get the expected production out of their trio of tight ends (Eric Ebron, Brandon Pettigrew and Joseph Fauria) that they had hoped for in 2014, but all three stood out with their blocking, which helped Detroit overcome some of its own inconsistencies.

Johnson’s main priority in Oakland will be trying to get the same or more out of the Raiders tight ends. While Rivera’s job is safe -- he’s the clear-cut starter -- the team doesn’t have much depth behind him. Oakland will look to improve that either through the draft or free agency.

One option could Denver’s Julius Thomas, who is scheduled to hit the free-agent market this offseason. Thomas grew up a fan of the Raiders and has already gone on record saying Oakland is a team he would definitely consider playing for.

Either way, look for Johnson to be very hands-on with whomever the Raiders bring in.                                                                                                                            0279450-8e12694ac78662bbe58701e200d0650d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005317 00000000000 014677  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Nearly 3 million Dish Network subscribers in 18 cities have lost access to their local CBS television station — just two days before Thanksgiving, when many Americans want to watch NFL football.

The blackout comes amid a contentious fee dispute between satellite TV provider Dish Network and CBS Corp., which owns the television stations. Customers in New York, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Denver and other markets also were hit by the blackout, which in addition to the local stations includes three CBS cable channels: CBS Sports Network, Smithsonian Channel and Pop.

“Now, Dish subscribers are in jeopardy of being without CBS over the Thanksgiving holiday, which would mean they would miss CBS Sports’ NFL and SEC football coverage beginning Thursday,” CBS said in a statement late Monday.

CBS is set to broadcast the NFL matchup between the Chargers and the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving.

The outage began at 9 p.m. CST on Monday. That’s when the companies’ previous carriage contract expired, leaving Dish without authorization to retransmit the signals of CBS stations.

Dish immediately struck back, offering to install an over-the-air antenna for most customers affected by the outage so they could continue to receive CBS. The satellite TV provider also promised to reduce subscribers’ bills by $10 per month if they agreed to drop the local TV stations from their lineup.

Dish blamed the dispute on CBS’ demands for higher retransmission and cable affiliate fees even as viewership has declined. Such higher broadcast fees are contributing to the steady increases in pay-TV bills. Dish has been struggling to contain programming costs as it loses customers.

“We are actively working to negotiate an agreement that promptly returns this content to Dish’s programming lineup,” Warren Schlichting, Dish’s executive vice president of marketing, programming and media sales, said in a statement.

The Englewood, Colo.-based satellite TV company noted that CBS has boasted on its earnings calls with Wall Street analysts that it will generate $2.5 billion a year in retransmission fees for its stations by 2020 — up from $250 million a year in 2012.

“Those desired increases come as Dish customers are watching less CBS,” Dish said in its statement. According to Dish, average viewership for CBS is down 20% over the last three years.

Already this year, there have been 212 programming blackouts on various pay-TV systems — more than double the number from last year, according to the American Television Alliance, a Washington-based group that represents cable and satellite TV providers. That’s a dramatic rise from 2010, when there were just eight blackouts.

The dates of each game will be determined in the spring when the full regular-season schedule is released.

Home opponents (*playoff team): Baltimore (London), Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Seattle*, San Diego, Houston*, Indianapolis, Tennessee.

Away opponents (*playoff team): Cleveland, Pittsburgh*, Arizona, San Francisco, New York Jets, Houston*, Indianapolis, Tennessee.

My take: On paper, this looks like a manageable schedule, with seven of the 13 opponents finishing 2016 with losing records (that number will increase by one if the Jaguars beat the Colts on Sunday). Of course, the Jaguars have won just three games against a schedule that included five teams that finished 2015 with winning records and made the playoffs, including defending Super Bowl champion Denver. Another notable things about the 2017 schedule: The Jaguars -- who will have a new head coach -- could be facing as many as six new head coaches. There will be a new coach in Los Angeles, but there also could be changes in Cincinnati (Marvin Lewis), San Diego (Mike McCoy) and the New York Jets (Todd Bowles). The situations in Indianapolis with Chuck Pagano and San Francisco with Chip Kelly bear watching, too.                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279411-b71763925b58ea62989a71169126d6fb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000021654 00000000000 014647  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Economic growth is a great thing

When the economy booms people make more, so they pay more income taxes. They spend more, which generates more sales tax. They upgrade homes and buy bigger homes, which have higher property taxes. But even though they pay more dollars in taxes, people are happy because they have more cash, and often the percent of their income spent overall on taxes is lower.

A virtuous circle where everyone benefits. Growth helps the citizens, and the community prospers.

For the industrial era, this virtuous circle was great for Illinois. Farmlands continued to prosper with bountiful crops, while new manufacturing jobs created higher incomes for those leaving farms. The roadways and airports grew, while income taxes remained almost paltry by national standards. And Illinois could boast some of the country's best public schools even while property taxes were below national averages. This growth environment kept locals in the state, and attracted people from the plains, other parts of the midwest, south and northeast as well as immigrants from foreign lands. Industrial growth propelled a great environment.

Illinois has a serious growth problem

Last week many people were surprised by a recent Gallup survey showing that Illinois leads the USA in people wanting to leave their home state. A whopping 50% of the population would like to leave. And Illinois was 2nd from the top with percentage of people who have high intent to actually leave (at 19%.) So if those two groups overlap Illinois could lose 10% of its population in short order!

If ever there was one, this has to be a wake-up call!

The seeds of this problem were sown many years ago. When manufacturing started going offshore, Illinois was hard hit. A Center for Government Studies report shows that between 2000 and 2010 the number of people employed in Illinois actually declined by 115,000 (1.5%). Farming, wholesale and retail trade jobs fell by 135,000. But far worse was the decline in manufacturing jobs, which dropped by a whopping 311,000. Those were jobs which had been Illinois' growth foundation for 60 years. And they were the employers who provided the network effect of business-to-business growth that kept the state's virtuous circle spinning.

Despite the obviousness of this shift in employment - from manufacturing to services - the state reacted timidly to replace manufacturing employment with another growth vehicle. In an era of growing financial services, Illinois failed to develop a strong banking sector, and in fact watched First Chicago/Bank One become JPMorganChase and leave - along with almost all its other large brethren.

Despite leading engineering universities (University of Illinois Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana/Champaign, Northwestern, Illinois Institute of Technology, Northern Illinois, etc.) Illinois failed to develop a vibrant angel investing or venture capital community, and digital entrepreneurs were pushed toward the coasts for funding - and increasingly the talent followed them out of state.

Illinois' virtuous circle became a stagnation spiral

As jobs left the state there was lower demand for housing, so people couldn't sell their houses - especially after 2007. The housing bust that racked America hit the Chicago area, and all of Illinois, harder than many metros. And home prices have failed to recover at anything close to the national average. Chicagoland still leads major metro areas in percentage of homes with underwater mortgages.

To maintain money for schools and roads, as real estate values plummeted, new home construction halted, and sales disintegrated, communities were forced to raise property taxes. Today many people, especially in the 6 Chicago "collar counties," pay property taxes that are higher than similar homes in Los Angeles and San Francisco! Chicago area property taxes have become among the highest in the country.

With no growth in spending, communities raised sales taxes to generate more income. Today most Illinois citizens pay between 9-10% sales tax, again amongst the highest in the country. Which encourages even greater on-line shopping, and further deterioration in the local retail trade.

Road maintenance, and general funding at the state level, pushed the state to raise highway tolls. What were $.25 toll machines on major arteries in the 1990s now cost $.75 (tripled) and the rate is double that ($1.50) if you don't install an electronic toll device in your auto (sorry out-of-state drivers.)

Lacking growth, state income tax receipts could not keep up with state demands - especially for pensions that depended on both a vibrant stock market as well as higher state income. So Illinois doubled the income tax rate in an effort to fund pensions and avoid bankruptcy.

Yet, despite seeing taxes in all areas increase, residents are subject to declining services. Potholes remain an ever-present danger for drivers. Municipal traffic services (buses and rail) have increased prices by multiples, yet there are fewer routes and longer waits for customers. Many communities have been forced to lay off police and first responders.

Aging population hurts economic growth

Which leads to an even worse element of stagnation - aging population. As the jobs for people 16-44 declined, younger people left the state and that demographic actually declined by 3.2% between 2000 and 2010. Those who remained were older, so the Baby Boomers grew by 21%! However, this aged demographic is not in its prime "spending years," and instead is much more likely to invest for retirement. Thus further dampening the local economy.

And, an aging population means that the number of children declined - dramatically. The "baby bust" resulted in a 6.2% decline in children under age 10 in Illinois last decade. Fewer children means less demand for school teachers, and all the things related to child rearing, further shrinking the economic growth prospects. While this is good news for property tax payers generally, it's never a good sign to see closed schools simply because there's no need for them.

Now the spiral becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Retiring boomers on a fixed income realize that they cannot afford to live in a state with such high, and rising, property taxes. Especially when other states have fixed taxes that are 1/4 to 1/3 what they pay in Illinois. These retirees (or soon to be retirees) discover lower property tax states often have sales taxes that are half what they pay in Illinois. The economics of staying become increasingly difficult to bear - while the benefits of leaving look ever more promising.

Hard to recruit new jobs when you compete with low-tax states

Entrepreneurs and business leaders see little reason to move more jobs into Illinois. When looking at facility locations they realize they can receive the same tax breaks almost anywhere, but employees would prefer the lower tax environment of other states - especially sun belt states like Texas which has no income tax. As Illinois offers tax breaks to dinosaurs like Sears, desperately trying to keep jobs despite failing corporate prospects, it becomes increasingly difficult to lure anyone other than small-employing headquarters locations into the state. And personal taxes keep going up to compensate for these ill-conceived legacy company support programs.

No wonder so many people think about leaving Illinois. And we haven't even mentioned the weather (do you know how to spell P-O-L-A-R V-O-R-T-E-X?)

Growth is a wonderful thing.

Everyone prospers when economic growth provides the virtual circle of more cash. But when the market turns toward the stagnation spiral - well it sucks for just about everyone.

Just ask the folks in Detroit - who are now auctioning off empty homes for $1,000 on the internet just to stop ongoing blight that is wrecking the city like an economic tsunami.

There is no simple answer for a declining economy like Illinois

But this situation took over 2 decades to create. Failure to recognize the decline in manufacturing, and shift to digital economy jobs, left political and industry leaders arrogantly thinking everything would be fine. An inability to invest in creating a replacement powerhouse industry means the state has few resources to invest in anything at all now. Unable to leverage local university innovation with a comprehensive and effective program for funding projects has created a veritable slipper-slide from Illinois to California or New York for new graduates.

The answer will take some time to develop, and implement. But one thing is clear, if Illinois' leaders don't come up with something soon there will be even fewer people around, and even greater problems developing. It would be easy to dismiss this Gallup poll, or let community pride keep one from taking its implications seriously. But that would be an even worse mistake. This is a serious wake-up call.

This was after the Indian side did not agree to a request by the Chinese authorities to dismantle it, sources have told agencies.

China had objected to India building new bunkers and upgrading older ones along the border in Sikkim in the recent past to shore up its defences.

With the defence ministry, the home ministry and the external affairs ministry maintaining a deafening silence on the latest stand-off the Doka La general area in the Sikkim section of the Indo-China border, it is the Chinese narrative that is acquiring prime media space. While the standoff first took place on June 17, no official Indian government reaction has been forthcoming since then.

Indian officials have been offering a terse “no comment” while Chinese state-owned media “criticised the Indian side for violating the consensus on border issues and agreements between the two governments, seriously endangering peace along the border areas”.

The Global Times ran a story: ‘Indian troops’ provocation brings disgrace to themselves’.

Both the Indian Army and the ITBP guard the Sikkim stretch of the border, with the latter coming under the home ministry.                                                                                                                                                                              0279452-94a77540144f874dd024c7746bcd28eb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000014032 00000000000 014771  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        JasonParis/Flickr

When it comes to housing access, New York City is an especially hard place to live for trans and gender non-conforming people.

In 2014, Cecilia Gentili and her partner were ready to move in together. It was a big step for their longterm relationship. When the couple started scouring Craigslist for the perfect home, Gentili—42 at the time—knew what she wanted: a two-bedroom in Ridgewood, Queens (where she lived at the time), close to the train, with a kitchen island and a patio out back. And they found one that fit all those criteria. She called a broker on the phone, and the prospect seemed like a slam dunk; she and her partner had steady jobs and great credit. They decided to go see the place. Gentili identifies as a transgender woman; when she met the broker in person, the man fell silent, stared, and asked if she was Cecilia. When she answered affirmatively, he told her he’d forgotten the address of the place and excused himself, saying he’d get in touch. It never happened. Gentili prefers not to revisit such interactions in her life. They’re too painful—“a constant reminder that I can’t get what I need in life because of who I am,” she says. “We can’t change who we are. I am trans.” Her experience is one of three highlighted in a brief on housing discrimination against transgender and gender non-conforming people released by the office of New York City Public Advocate Letitia James on Friday—International Transgender Day of Visibility.

Like in Gentili’s case, the discrimination is often not explicit. Brokers will suddenly run out of open apartments, and landlords will say they don’t accept Section 8 vouchers or other housing assistance. “Most of these discriminatory acts happen under the veil of normalcy—but I know what happened,” Gentili says of her experience. Many states still openly allow housing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. In the other cases, the ill-treatment is overt—ugly, even—with transgender applicants identified as “prostitutes” and “risks,” according to the report. Brokers often ask for additional fees for the “extra effort” of finding an apartment, and landlords charge a higher upfront deposit, without any guarantee of return. And even after a transgender person ends up signing a lease, the harassment may not stop. Reports of name-calling and violent threats are common. And if the victim complains, they can be evicted. The most economically or socially vulnerable are at most risk. Landlords will often threaten to report undocumented transgender tenants, for example, if they don’t voluntarily leave their apartments. Or they’ll simply stop providing services or repairs till the apartment is unlivable. It’s no wonder that vulnerable transgender tenants often end up homeless. Such treatment by landlords and brokers is, of course, illegal. While the Fair Housing Act doesn’t explicitly include sexual orientation and gender expression within its protected classes, according to guidance provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), “discrimination against a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) person may be covered by the Fair Housing Act if it is based on non-conformity with gender stereotypes.” Additionally, New York City has had laws protecting transgender folks on the books for years, and in 2015, released guidance clarifying the scope and penalties.

But ending housing discrimination is still quite a long way off. The first problem is that there’s not enough data on how many such cases are actually out there. Among the 500-plus respondents from New York surveyed by the National Center For Transgender Equality in 2015, 19 percent reported being denied a home or apartment. (Of the 28,000 respondents nationwide, 23 percent experienced housing discrimination.) That’s the most authoritative statistic available on this issue, and it’s probably understated, advocates say.

Community-based service providers are in the best position to track and compile discrimination cases, because victims trust them and are more likely to come forward. But often, these organizations lack resources do that kind of data collection. Providing them with grants for that intake is the first step toward solving the problem, according to the NYC Public Advocate’s report.

Another recommendation: Make it easier to complain. Victims of housing discrimination can call 311 and tell their story to the Human Rights Commission. But in order to pursue legal actions, the complainant has to come in to the office in Manhattan. That’s a barrier to entry, which is why the report suggests expanding the city’s capacity to take in and deal with these complaints in the outer boroughs. Then, once the city starts bringing in better data, it should send transgender “testers” out to catch repeat offenders in the act, the report suggests. (In 2013, HUD deployed white and minority testers and found widespread, albeit subtle, housing discrimination continues to exist.) Other solutions include creating a repository of successful court cases and educating landlords and homeless shelters. Many states still openly allow housing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Older members of this group face particular challenges. Unlike some of these places, New York has been a bastion for gay and transgender rights. But when it comes to housing access, it’s an especially hard place to live. “Housing is difficult because housing is expensive,” Gentili says. Trans people already face systemic barriers to education and employment, she says. But even if they overcome them, and get to a point where they can afford a home for themselves and their loved ones, complete with a patio and kitchen island, transphobia thwarts them again. “People fear what they don’t know, and many people don’t know anything in trans people,” she says. “That fear translates to action.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0279386-05c6ac8ad28a5f2ccb4ebe882b460d32.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000021003 00000000000 015327  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        By RICCARDO BIANCHINI - 2017-11-02

The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art is a museum of fine and applied arts in Kansas City, Missouri. Established in 1933 and renowned for its collections of European, American and Asian art, the museum was expanded in 2007 with the iconic Bloch Building, designed by Steven Holl. Architects.

History

The museum originates from two separate grants, one by publisher William Rockhill Nelson (1841-1915) and another by school teacher and heiress Mary McAfee Atkins (1836-1911), both aimed to establish a new museum of art in Kansas City.

Instead of creating two separate institutions, the trustees decided to join forces and found a single major museum, initially named The William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art and the Mary Atkins Museum of Fine Arts.

The museum’s imposing neoclassical-style building, designed by Wight & Wight Architects, opened to the public on December 1, 1933.

Like many other American museums founded in the same period, the Nelson-Atkins is an encyclopedic art museum whose collections spans a period of over 4000 years, from ancient to contemporary art. Furthermore, the museum’s collections encompasses various geographical areas – Far and Near East, Africa, Europe, and the Americas – and art fields – including painting, sculpture, photography, archaeology, architecture, design, and decorative arts.

Steven Holl’s expansion

In 2007, a 165,000-square-foot (15,330-square-meter) addition to the Nelson-Atkins museum, called Bloch Building, was completed after a design by acclaimed American architect Steven Holl.

Rather than designing a single, large expansion, Holl conceived five interconnected buildings, clad in translucent glass, creating a 850-foot-long sequence of boxes whose overall profile follows that of the terrain they sit onto; a sinuous path, which borders the museum’s sculpture park on its eastern edge, connects one building to the next.

Holl called such boxes lenses because the convex shape of their glass-clad southern facades was conceived to reflect and focus sunlight on the northern facade of the nearest box, thus maximizing and somewhat “amplifying” natural lighting in the exhibition galleries.

The first box contains the museum’s lobby, a library, and a bookshop, and gives access to both the historical building and the new wing.

On five levels, the other four pavilions accommodate the museum’s galleries dedicated to modern and contemporary art, to photography and African art, and to special exhibitions. Furthermore, a small sculpture court with works by Isamu Noguchi is located between the two southern boxes.

Holl also designed a new entry plaza which features a square water mirror – which reflects the old building’s northern and the new expansion’s western facades – as well a monumental sculpture from the series Shuttlecocks by Claes Oldenburg & Coosje van Bruggen (three others are installed in the museum’s park) which has become a sort of unofficial symbol of the Nelson-Atkins.

Another work, the sculpture One Sun / 34 Moons commissioned by the museum to American artist Walter De Maria, stands in the middle of the reflecting pool. An underground parking is located just beneath the entrance plaza.

Holl’s building features various sustainable building techniques, such as green roofing, double glass skin ventilated facades, rainwater collecting and recycling systems, and an adaptable day-lighting system equipped with computer-controlled sunscreens.

Collections and permanent exhibition

As mentioned, the collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art is quite diverse and covers different historical periods, geographical areas, and art techniques.

Overall, the 35,000-piece collection of the museum is divided into thirteen thematic sections, dedicated to the art of Africa, America, Indian America, China, Europe, Japan, and South and Southeast Asia; to Modern, and Contemporary art; to Architecture, design and decorative arts; to Photography; and to Ancient Art – with artifacts from Ancient Egypt, Greece, Italy, North Africa, and the Near East.

The thirteen section is the 22-acre Donald J. Hall sculpture park in which works by contemporary artists such as Henry Moore, Mark Di Suvero, Alexander Calder, and Tony Cragg, among others.

Pieces in the Nelson-Atkins Museum’s painting collection includes masterpieces by El Greco, Rembrandt van Rjin, Bronzino, Caravaggio, Claude Monet, Edgard Degas, Thomas Cole, John Singer Sargent, Marcel Duchamp, Juan Gris, Wassily Kandinsky, Jackson Pollock, Georgia O’Keeffe, Willem de Kooning, Andy Warhol, and Robert Raushenberg.

The sculpture collection comprises works dating from antiquity to the present, from remarkable ancient-Egyptian pieces to modern and contemporary works by artists such as Constantin Brancusi, Alberto Giacometti, Isamu Noguchi, Donald Judd, and Anish Kapoor.

Objects in the design and decorative arts collection includes American and European furniture, pottery, arms and armor, glass objects and silvers dating from the Middle Ages to the 21st century.

Activities and services

The program of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art comprises special exhibitions, learning classes, art workshops, film screenings, live performances and concerts, and family events.

The museum’s building, fully accessible to physically-impaired people except for the sculpture garden and the Rozzelle Court restaurant, includes a 500-seat cinema-auditorium, a learning center, an art reference library, a cafe-restaurant, and a shop.

They are wanted for visiting Karabakh, as well as for acting as monitors of the referendum, which Baku deemed illegal.

Warrants were issued for Frank Engel of Luxembourg, Eleni Theocharous of Cyprus and Jaromir Stetina of the Czech Republic, who were among more than 100 monitors from 30 countries to visit Artsakh for Monday’s vote. They and other observers deemed the referendum, which overwhelmingly approved a new Constitution for Artsakh, democratic and fair.

Azerbaijani media reported Wednesday that Baku had asked Interpol to execute the arrest warrants. However, Armenia’s Human Rights Ombudsman, Armen Tatoyan told reporters on Thursday that according to Armenia’s national police the three members of the European Parliament are not wanted by Interpol.

Meanwhile, Armenia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Shavarsh Kocharyan on Thursday called the criminal case against the legislators “ridiculous.”

“The Azerbaijani authorities have long turned everything into a farce – both international law and their domestic life,” said Kocharyan. “It’s ridiculous and can in no way affect the visits to Artsakh.”

Tatoyan, the human rights defender, expressed confidence that such steps from Baku will not deter journalists and politicians from visiting Artsakh, and in fact it may make them more frequent.

“A vivid indication of this was the visit of 104 foreign observers from 30 countries during the Constitutional referendum in Artsakh. All of them, including Frank Engel, Eleni Theocharous and Jaromir Stetina, are advocates of democratic values. The visits of foreign guests and their activity in Artsakh have always and will always be lawful,” said Tatoyan.

“We have to do our best to attain recognition of Artsakh with its democratic institutions,” said the ombudsman.

“it is high time to eliminate the so-called ‘black list.’ No vicious step by Azerbaijan will ever hamper the development of democracy in Artsakh,” added Tatoyan.

A prominent Russian legal expert, Denis Dvornikov called Baku’s move “hysteria.”

“The referendum on Constitutional amendments held in Nagorno Karabakh has greatly irritated the neighboring country. However, I am convinced that Interpol will reject such an application, as it will become a dangerous precedent the world over. In addition to that, Interpol officials have respect towards their spare time and work, as when one precedent is formed, they will receive similar requests regarding all the disputed territories of the world. This is a political issue,” said Dvornikov.

He noted that such an act by Azerbaijan is more directed toward its own population to demonstrate that their leaders can somehow affect the Nagorno Karabakh referendum.

He also reiterated Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov‘s sentiments that it was unacceptable to ban someone from visiting a place.

“He [Lavrov] made it clear that visits to Artsakh are not forbidden,” Dvornikov said adding that eventually Azerbaijan’s actions will also cast a pall for international organizations, as they have Lavrov.

“Criminalizing visits to Artsakh is a threat to Russia’s national security and territorial integrity. This is a very important matter,” Dvornikov underscored referring to the disputes of Crimea and Kuril Islands.

Baku’s actions against the European Parliament members comes weeks after a Russian-Israeli blogger, Aleksander Lapshin, was extradited to Baku on a similar warrant on charges of visiting Artsakh and denigrating Azerbaijan in his articles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279331-1a741e08008a0b9cf49408f1e90cde10.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010207 00000000000 015016  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Can someone tell me? Seriously? This isn’t a bit.

I’m on it. I’ve found some friends from high school and college. I play Scrabble (excuse me, “Scrabulous”), but when I read an article where they talk about it being worth billions of dollars, I have to ask myself this question:

“Really??”

For what? A place to put up a few pictures and send your friends a message once in a while?

Maybe I’m just old, but I really don’t get it.

It’s basically the same thing as Myspace. Which is basically the same thing as Friendster. Do we really need all of these?

If you’re like me, you do what you’re told, subject your own will and migrate with the herd.

First, there was Friendster, then for some reason, the collective decided it was no longer cool and then it went to Myspace, which was equally stupid and annoying, but had more people on it. Then the same thing happened again with Facebook.

Really??

I don’t have anything better to do with my time?

Well, no, actually I don’t. But you should. You’ve got a job, or a family, or both. You have things to do, places to see, people to drink coffee with.

Why is this thing worth so much goddam money?

You hear alot about “the apps”. Maybe it’s the apps?

“Oh, it’s the apps!” they’ll say!

What the fuck is an “app”!?!

Does that mean “application”? I think it does, but to be honest, I’m nowhere near 100% sure of that.

I actually went and looked it up on wikipedia, which had this to say about it:

Features of the website include … pokes for sending virtual “pokes”.

That’s a feature?? That’s fucking annoying, that’s what it is! Do you like when people poke you in real life? No, of course not. In some cultures, that’s grounds for murder. But it’s supposed to be fun when you’re online? Fuck you, Facebook!

I go online to avoid physical contact with people. So what does this 4 billion dollar ass bucket do? It takes that away from me. Now any douchebag on my friend list can poke me anytime they want. They can even do much, much worse than that, it seems.

Which leads me to the real reason I hate this goddam piece of shit: Vampires.

Vampires, Werewolves, “Which Star Trek Character Are You?” quizzes. All that shit. I guess these are what they mean by “apps” and “pokes”. But again, not totally sure.

If you have ever sent me any of these things, I hate you. If you have spent $1 of real money to send me a virtual gift, you should hate yourself.

Yes, you read that correctly. If you’re unaware, on Facebook, you can buy your friend a latte! Only it’s not a real latte! It’s a picture of one! But it costs real money!

So when you look at it like that, you can see what the genius of this thing really is. It’s a giant contraption that does nothing but trick people into thinking their money is worthless, then make you feel like it’s doing you a favor by taking your worthless money off your hands for you, so that you are free to go back to drinking paint or whatever you did to damage your brain to the point that you think any of this is a good idea, let alone, fun.

I’m not done yet.

It occurs to me, as I’m writing this, that it’s all a little bit high school-cliquish. And by ‘a little bit’ I mean ‘exactly alike in every single way.’

Think about it: When did you leave Friendster? When everybody was on it and it wasn’t cool and all the cool people went to Myspace. Then that happened again.

I remember thinking the best part about Facebook is that it wasn’t all profiles for somebody’s cat or their pet rock. There weren’t random stalkers pretending to be Bill Murray. It was all real people that I knew in real life, to some capacity.

But now that’s gone too. The same people I don’t know in real life on Myspace have followed me over to Facebook. So has their page for their shitty band I’m never going to go see or listen to or even swerve to avoid with my car if I see them crossing the street with their music gear.

By my calculations, I guess it’s time for the new Facebook. But when you find it, don’t go and tell everyone else about it, just me, because I’m not sure how much longer I can do this.

Tang, a pigtailed, 30-something cosmetology major, had never considered herself the activist type. Like many other Chinese citizens, she kept a blog where she wrote about current events and her life, but she wasn't political.

A few days later, however, Tang surprised herself. She logged on to her computer and signed the document by sending her full name, location and occupation to a special e-mail address.

"I was afraid, but I had already signed it hundreds of times in my heart," Tang said in an interview.

Hers is the 3,943rd signature on the list that has swelled to more than 8,100 from across China. Although their numbers are still small, those signing the document, and the broad spectrum from which they come, have made the human rights manifesto, known as Charter 08, a significant marker in the demands for democracy in China, one of the few sustained campaigns since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Those who sign the charter risk arrest and punishment.

When the document first appeared online in mid-December, its impact was limited. Many of the original signers were lawyers, writers and other intellectuals who had long been known for their pro-democracy stance. The Chinese government moved quickly to censor the charter -- putting those suspected of having written it under surveillance, interrogating those who had signed, and deleting any mention of it from the Internet behind its great firewall.

Then something unusual happened. Ordinary people such as Tang with no history of challenging the government began to circulate the document and declare themselves supporters. The list now includes scholars, journalists, computer technicians, businessmen, teachers and students whose names had not been associated with such movements before, as well as some on the lower rungs of China's social hierarchy -- factory and construction workers and farmers.

"This is the first time that anyone other than the Communist Party has put in written form in a public document a political vision for China," said Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor of journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, a human rights activist and director of the China Internet Project, which monitors conversation on China's vast network of electronic bulletin-board systems, blogs and Web sites. "It's dangerous to be associated with dissidents, so in the past, other, ordinary people have not signed such documents. But this time it is different. It has become a citizens' movement."

The party in China maintains a monopoly on power, but its authority is now being challenged in the charter and on a number of other philosophical fronts.

On Jan. 13, a group of more than 20 Chinese intellectuals signed an open letter calling for a boycott of state television news programs because of what they said is systematic bias and brainwashing, and separately, a Beijing newspaper ran a commentary that argued that freedom of speech is written into the constitution and that the authorities cannot solely decide whether something is "absurd versus not, or progressive versus reactionary."

On Jan. 7, a prominent Chinese lawyer, Yan Yiming, went to the Finance Ministry and filed an application demanding that it open to the public its 2008 and 2009 budget books, including information about its $586 billion economic stimulus plan. "Our government must exercise its power in the open sunlight," Yan wrote.

And early this month, the editors of the newspaper Southern Weekend echoed text from Charter 08 but did not directly refer to it when the paper expressed worry about the future of the state and said it supports "progress, democracy, freedom, human rights."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279437-49c51d2b1e4a97e2b057f67b671b0bdf.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004614 00000000000 015206  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Beginning in 2010, Mr. Zanjani, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told the magazine and, in a separate meeting, the semiofficial Iranian Students’ News Agency that he used a spider web of 64 companies in Dubai, Turkey and Malaysia to sell millions of barrels of oil, earning $17.5 billion in desperately needed foreign exchange for Iran’s Oil Ministry, Revolutionary Guards and central bank.

“The central bank was running out of money,” he said in the Aseman interview, published last week. In 2010, “they asked me to bring their oil money into Iran so the system could use it,” Mr. Zanjani said of Iran’s political establishment. “So that is what I did.”

Among the companies he was controlling were a Turkish airline, various financial institutions and a fleet of oil tankers, many of which he put to use in evading the sanctions.

He devised a scheme to disguise the origins of Iranian oil and sell it on the open market, transferring millions of barrels from tanker to tanker — often in a little-known harbor on the tiny Malaysian island of Labuan in 2012, the European Union charges. In total, he said, he sold 24 million barrels of oil to buyers in Singapore, Malaysia and India and then laundered the money through Malaysian First Islamic Bank, which is now on all the sanctions lists.

“This is what I do — antisanctions operations,” Mr. Zanjani said. “I am a businessman who has done his job well. Since I was placed under sanctions they haven’t managed to sell even three million barrels of oil.”

Mr. Zanjani is sparse with details about his early business dealings, but admitted in the magazine interview that he had gotten his big break in 1999, when he became the driver for Mohsen Nourbaksh, the chief of Iran’s central bank. Mr. Zanjani displayed a talent for money changing, and said he was quickly earning around $17,000 a day — his cut on all the currency deals.

“This might be hard to believe, but God has helped me all my life,” he said.

In 2010 he was approached by Khatam al-Anbia, the engineering arm of the Revolutionary Guards, which was prevented by the sanctions from repatriating money from abroad. Using his own bank, Mr. Zanjani said, he managed to get the group $40 million in a couple of days.                                                                                                                    0279408-f0ee40b19b51a189edb2d820984e607b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012202 00000000000 015114  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        "Pint Craft is a game I would gladly recommend to other Gamer Geeks and to Parent Geeks who I knew were micro brew followers or created their own beers." ~ Father Geek

What if I don’t reach the goal?

Kickstarter is All-or-Nothing funding. That means that if Pint Craft doesn’t reach the goal of $12,000 by November 25, then it does not get funded. If you pledge to support Pint Craft, you will only pay after this campaign crosses the $12,000 mark. The best way to make sure you can enjoy Pint Craft is to tell your friends, family, and homebrew club all about the game. As soon as this project achieves its funding goal I can guarantee it will be produced and delivered.

I chose the goal based on the production costs for a 500 copy run - which is the minimum to get offset printing through Blue Panther. The $12,000 goal incorporates costs for printing, US shipping, fees, and miscellaneous items.

You can learn all about how Kickstarter works on their helpful FAQ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0279466-a21a72683954c941533b1d202658cd66.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002147 00000000000 014546  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Class will be in attendance at Brakebills University a little early, as Syfy will offer a chance to watch The Magicians‘ premiere ahead of its January debut.

Syfy has confirmed that The Magicians‘ pilot will have a special screening on the network on Dec. 16 at 10 p.m. ET, following the finale of the three-part Childhood’s End. The pilot will air commercial free on Dec. 16 before the show officially premieres on Jan. 25 at 9 p.m. ET.

Author Lev Grossman first announced the special airing. Syfy’s series adapts Grossman’s trilogy of novels, which follow the story of Quentin Coldwater, a New York high schooler obsessed with a series of children’s books about the magical world of Fillory. Disenchanted with the real world, Quentin is surprisingly accepted to the magicians school Brakebills, as a whole new world finds its way into Quentin’s life.

He faces likely pushback from conservatives, and he will also have to weigh many other competing priorities.

When radio host Hugh Hewitt asked incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus about a stimulus package that could be used to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, Priebus said that the administration would likely focus on tax reform and ObamaCare in the first nine months of the year.

In a November interview with The New York Times, Trump said that infrastructure won’t be the “core” of his first few years, but that he is interested in a large infrastructure bill.

Tax reform, Obamacare and appropriations “are going to push infrastructure right out of the way,” predicted Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute.

Trump’s nomination of fiscal conservative Mick Mulvaney, a Republican lawmaker from South Carolina who is a member of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, also raised eyebrows.

Mulvaney has made a name for himself in Washington as an advocate for cutting spending, and would appear to be a potential voice within the administration arguing against heavy infrastructure spending.

The Trump transition website states that “the Trump Administration seeks to invest $550 billion to ensure we can export our goods and move our people faster and safer,” but it does not explain how that investment would be made.

In August, Trump suggested that he’d finance infrastructure spending through bonds. But later in the campaign, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, Trump’s picks to lead the Commerce Department and a new White House trade council respectively, together developed a plan to boost private sector infrastructure investment with tax credits.

A document on Trump’s first 100 days that his campaign released in October seems to reference the Ross-Navarro plan, saying that Trump would leverage “public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years.” Campaign aides argued that this plan would be revenue neutral.

On Dec. 20, the Washington Post reported that Trump was planning to create an infrastructure "task force" that would help move forward on the issue.

Besides Mulvaney, Trump has named people to top administration jobs who have diverse views on the importance of infrastructure spending.

His choice for Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told reporters last month that Trump was considering an infrastructure bank. Ross and Navarro, however, criticized Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesman: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE’s proposal of direct government spending and an infrastructure bank.

Trump has nominated Elaine Chao, who served as Labor Secretary under President George W. Bush, to be his Transportation Secretary.

Chao is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse to push back at Trump on border Democrats block abortion bill in Senate Overnight Energy: Climate protesters storm McConnell’s office | Center-right group says Green New Deal could cost trillion | Dire warnings from new climate studies MORE (R-Ky.), who earlier this month did not sound keen on an infrastructure spending plan. “I hope we avoid a trillion-dollar stimulus,” he told reporters.

Edwards said he doesn’t think Chao herself would be in favor of a large federal spending plan.

“She [was] probably the most conservative member of the Bush administration,” he said.

In a questionnaire Chao submitted to the Senate Commerce Committee, she did not name new infrastructure funding or financing as one of DOT’s top priorities. Instead, she emphasized streamlining the construction process and balancing between priorities in urban and rural areas.

But a Trump transition team spokesman told CNN that Chao "is completely aligned with the President-elect's plans to invest in America's infrastructure, and she understands the critical connection between our infrastructure and our competitiveness.”

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the outgoing Freedom Caucus chairman, said that Mulvaney would make sure that Trump is being fiscally responsible, though he also said the budget director could work to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure.

“President-elect Trump chose my friend Mick Mulvaney for director of the Office of Management and Budget because he understands our nation’s financial situation and will work to restore fiscal sanity while also rebuilding America’s infrastructure,” Jordan said.

If he backtracks, they are just as likely to criticize him.

Fiscal conservatives tend to think increasing federal infrastructure spending is bad policy given the size of the nation’s deficit. They don’t view many infrastructure projects as a federal responsibility and often argue that advocates exaggerate the number of jobs that will be created.

A spokesman for House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) said that it’s too early to discuss the timing and substance of a bill.

But the committee plans to work with the incoming administration and other lawmakers “in exploring options that make smart, fiscally responsible investments and help ensure America has a 21st century infrastructure,” the spokesman added.

Despite the challenges, infrastructure groups are publicly hopeful that Congress will pass a bill.

“We are cautiously optimistic that Mr. Trump will move this along,” said Kevin Burke, CEO of Airports Council International — North America.

Jim Tymon, chief operating officer of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, said that if the administration is looking for an “early bipartisan win,” infrastructure would fit the bill.

“It’s not a slam dunk that it’s one of the first issues out of the gate, but we think there’s a case to be made for it,” he said.

Mark W. MacWilliams: "The Holy Man's Hut as a Symbol of Stability in Japanese Buddhist Pilgrimage" in Numen vol. 47, 2000, p. 387-416.

This article concentrates on medieval to eighteenth-century Pure Land Buddhism in Japanese tales and traditional portraits of hermits, huts, statues, temples, and pilgrimage.

The very notion of pilgrimage had a dualistic history in Japan. From medieval times, the eremitic hijiri or wandering holy men promoted the use of pilgrimage by identifying sacred places, dedicated to Kannon, the bodhisattva of compassion, benefactor of favors and securer of rebirth in the Pure Land.

On the other hand, another Buddhist medieval tradition maintained that pilgrimage had no value because ultimately there is no "place" or "space" that is free of suffering of the cycle of karma.

Travel

Reconciling these traditions was the idea of travel. Travel was an excellent metaphor for transience, emphemerality, and the passing of life to death. This sentiment is poignantly expressed by Ippen, the itinerant holy man of the 13th century:

While transmigrating through the six paths [of rebirth], there is no one for company; alone we are born, alone we die; full of sorrow is this road of birth and death.

Addressing this dichotomy of space and ephemerality (mujo) is the human dwelling exemplified by the hermit's hut. The representative example is found in Kamo no Chomei's 13th century essay, "Account of My Hut." Chomei describes the capital and its palatial houses as quintessential vanities of attempting to assert stability and permanence.

The flow of the river is a ceaseless and its waters are never the same. The bubbles that float in the pools, now vanishing, now forming, are not of long duration. So in the world are man and his dwellings. It might be imagined that the houses, great and small, which vie roof against proud roof in the capital, remain unchanged from one generation to the next, but when we examine whether this is true, how few are the houses that were of old. Some houses were burnt last year and only since rebuilt. Great houses have crumbled into hovels and those who dwell in them have fallen no less. The city is the same, the people are as numerous as ever, but of those I used to know, a bare one or two in twenty remain. They die in the morning, they are born in the evening, like foam on the water.

Chomei's essay describes the results of a series of disasters that struck the city: fire, earthquake, storms, and floods -- all reinforcing the lesson of impermanence. In response, Chomei chooses to dwell in a modest hut not merely simple but even portable, small enough to disassemble with the prospect of disaster.

It is a bare ten feet square and less than seven feet high. I did not choose this particular spot rather than another, and I built it without consulting diviners. I laid a foundation and roughly thatched a roof. I fastened hinges to the joints of the beams, the easier to move elsewhere should anything displease me. What would be difficult about changing my dwelling? A bare two carts would suffice to carry off the whole house. Except for the carrier's fee there would be no expense at all.

Chomei's hut is a response to mujo, albeit a "utopian" one. This mobility is in harmony with the law of impermanence, affords a spiritual discipline, and ultimately, says author MacWilliams,

offers a life of spiritual freedom because it mitigates the negative effects of transmigration by flowing with change rather than struggling against it, as the traveling hermit follows the path of least resistance.

Kannon tales

But a second way of capturing the metaphor of life as travel is in the concept of pilgrimage. The Kannon temples along the Saikoku and Bando routes were founded by hermits as an alternative way of conceiving of place and space. Already hermits had built themselves huts as permanent dwellings, and by the eleventh century these huts were looked upon as sacred places, as dwellings erected in sacred places.

Thus the wandering hermit Shoku would find himself fed and kept warm in winter in his hut by miracles emanating from the beneficent Kannon. Similarly, Mount Shosha is made notable by the hermits who establish a temple to Kannon. By the eighteenth century, the miraculous character of the mountain is made explicit in folk literature and with the addition of a Buddha hall and Kannon image.

Author MacWilliam notes that there are

two important spatial motifs in the Saikoku and Bando pilgrimage tales. They suggest that the holy man's move is ultimately to a place beyond impermanence and instability. That the hermit's hut stands outside of this world of mujo, and not within it, is indicated in two important ways in the tales. First, the Kannon statue that a holy man carries with him or carves displays a preternatural mobility or immobility, which results in his building of a hut/temple on the site in which it is permanently enshrined. Second, the hut itself serves as a resting place for the ascetic where he can perform austerities for the greater good of those suffering in this world of mujo. Both motifs suggest that the holy man's hut (and later pilgrimage temple or reijo) with its spiritually powerful Kannon icon is a conduit for moving human beings off the rokudo -- from a life of painful instability to the Jodo, the Pure Land Paradise of Amida and Kannon.

Thus in this tradition of Pure Land tales, the holy men or hermits are not idle wanderers but simply traveling in order to find a suitable location for a Kannon temple. When the statue they carry becomes too heavy to carry any further (preternatural immobility), the hermit realizes that the bodhisattva has chosen the temple site.

In the Rokkaku-do tale of Prince Shotoku, Shotoku rests in a forest from his travels and places his small Kannon statue in a willow tree. Later he tries to take it and cannot for it is too heavy to life. That night in a dream, Kannon reveals her intention that he build a temple on that spot.

A mysterious old woman appears, who leads Shotoku to a sacred cedar tree and tells him to use its wood in constructing the temple.

Similarly, the priest Dokyo carried a Kannon statue in search of a suitable place for it, having rescued it after becoming an exile. In the village of Chiyo, the statue becomes too heavy to bear. Dokyo prays to Kannon asking for a further sign confirming this miracle of immobility, and at once the statue flies into a tree, emitting light.

As MacWilliams points out, "preternatural immobility" has a long history in Indian Buddhist tradition, where even stories of the immobility of the Buddha's body occur. But in Japan, folk tales of the Shinto kami may be a likelier source of the Kannon statue stories. The kami wander until they find a place to dwell, usually a grouping of rocks, a tree, a pillar, even flowers; their dwellings become "god seats" or sacred sites. The kami (and their locations) are then venerated as local deities or tutelary guardians. The presences of Kannon as permanent spiritual temple resident, have more in common with these Japanese folk traditions than with the abstractions of Buddhist divinities in India.

Further, the Kannon statues are portrayed as escaping disasters such as fire, in vivid contrast to the capital palaces and structures Chomei describes as succumbing to flames. Several tales related how Kannon statues flee to safety during temple fires, easily relocating in nearby trees or caves, where they are effortlessly restored to rebuilt temple precincts. These examples of "preternatural mobility" represent the converse power of immobility. They confirm Kannon's fidelity to her decision of where to reside. The sites are indeed sacred, say the tales, but as MacWilliams notes, the sites also compensate for the absence of sites like India's directly associated with the historical Buddha. The Japanese sacred site become Japanese equivalents.

Though Kannon has chosen the sites as sacred (in line with kami folk tradition), the sites then become paradisal gateways (in line with Pure Land thought). The Saikoku and Bando tales illustrate this confluence of traditions by having the wandering hermits observe auspicious signs around the locale. Miraculous clouds, (purple or multicolored) are one common sign. Wonderful fragrance, celestial music, beautiful nature sounds of water, trees, and birds, and mystical light are other signs. Thus

holy men discover that the places where they build their huts emit mystical light. In the "Jiko-ji-engi," when meditating on a mountain, Jikun Washo saw an "ascetic forest emitting light of lapis lazuli, and when a perfumed wind blew through the leaves and branches, there was a sound of the tinkling of jewels and magical incantations."

These signs would naturally attract pilgrims. But further, the Pure Land sites are described (based on the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra) as mountainless plateaus easy to access, where no Mt. Sumeru exists. As MacWilliam notes, all these characteristics "mark the hermit's hut as a heterogeneous soteriological space, a Pure Land beyond the everyday spaces of the six courses."

Stability

A final motif in these Kannon stories of wandering ascetics is that of a holy man or hermit leaving the metaphoric road of suffering and impermanence to definitively enter a sacred space. We have already seen examples of hermits resting from their day's travel only to find their Kannon statue's immobility a sign that the hermit's travels have ended. The hut the hermit constructed along the way had been temporary, but the hut he now constructs to house the Kannon statue is but his last, the initial version of a temple.

To illustrate these stages, MacWilliams offers the example of the scholar-monk Gensan Shonin, who lived on an isolated spot on Mt. Hiei. One day he descended the mountain to attend to his mother's funeral. Afterwards he reflects:

Now I am returning to Mt. Hiei. Even if I am called a great religious scholar, what's it for anyway? ... He felt the impermanence of life keenly, and lost any inclination to return to Mt. Hiei. He immediately built a thatched hut, chanted only the nembutsu, and contemplated the world. One day he was looking up at [Mt. Yoshinine] peak and noticed the strange appearance of a purple cloud floating around it. When he climbed up to see, there was neither a buddha nor a hall. However, because of the auspicious sign of the purple clouds, he thought, "This, then, is a reichi," and he lived at that place thereafter.

The reichi is sacred space, that space filled with divine presence or spiritual intelligence. Gensan Shonin's path went from simple reclusion as a scholar-monk, to eremitism as a hermit, to holy man in a hut/temple. (Note that this story has no Kannon incident, except, perhaps, the purple clouds). Gensan had departed the path of atonement and suffering to enter the Pure Land path.

There is a duality to Gensen Shonin's new abode, however, a "paradoxical symbolism." The hut still resides (says the tale) in the valley of death and along the dark road -- suggesting pre-Buddhist Japanese imagery) -- but the hut is nevertheless on the boundary of light, transcendence, and stability. As MacWIlliams states:

It is important to note that the sacred stability of the hut/temple's location reflects not only Buddhist cosmological and paradisiacal notions, but also reflects an essential trait of Kannon, a trait that marks the bodhisattva off from the suffering sentient beings traversing the six courses. ...

For the hermit lives in the duality of here and not here. The hermit is accessible, and his hut is made of bamboo and thatch, a real hut. He eats, sleeps, hauls water, and chops wood, we might say. The hermit of these traditions is of the Pure Land school but illustrates important aspects of Japanese Buddhist culture.

Further, as MacWilliam concludes

Even Chomei, in his "Account of My Hut," finds himself abandoning his transient hut on occasion. ... He gets off the sorrowful road of birth and death [to visit temples built by ascetic predecessors]. It is these temple sites, which became the popular focus of Kannon Japanese Buddhist pilgrimage in Chomei's time, that continue to serve as stable centers of the bodhisattva's salvation from transmigration to the present day.

A handful of tweets was enough to spawn numerous stories like this one at Raw Story headlined, “CPAC scrambles to control damage after attendees wave Russian flags during Trump speech.” Of course there was a bit more to this story that many missed. Attendees at CPAC didn’t pick these up in a gift shop. Someone had been handing out Russian flags with Trump’s name on them:

CPAC confirms to me that it was liberal activist Ryan Clayton who was ejected today for handing out the Trump-branded Russian Flags. — David Martosko (@dmartosko) February 24, 2017

The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross reports that Clayton, “is the head of Americans Take Action, a mysterious left-wing activist group that seeks to reform the electoral system.” Clayton is apparently one of the people behind these celebrity videos seeking to get electors to change their votes. In short, this was a progressive stunt designed to generate headlines like this one by Matt Yglesias at Vox, “Trump fans were waving tiny Russian flags until CPAC staff confiscated them.”

Finally, have to give credit to Adam Baldwin whose tweet inspired my headline:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279476-a94ac807c3bac1860e4ee12fef7e2f1f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004321 00000000000 015423  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Hideo Kojima didn’t have to talk Sony into giving Death Stranding the thumbs up. They just pretty much handed him the keys to castle and said do as you like.

Kojima chose Sony for Death Stranding because it afforded him “a lot of freedom”

This is according to what Gameblog France was told by the man himself at E3 2016 this week.

Kojima said he was approached with offers by other company’s but due to his great relationship with Sony, and not having to convince them of anything, he jumped on its offer.

“For our first title, I wanted to make sure we would be in the best conditions,” he said (thanks, Google Translate). “I have great relationship with Sony,[which allows] me to concentrate on the creative part. Working with another partner, [they] would surely ask for more time on ancillary tasks.

“We would have taken time for contracts, and I do not think that things would have been as quick. Working with Sony also brought me a lot of freedom, and support has been exceptional.”

Kojima goes on to say that had he chosen a “normal company” he would have been bogged down with coming up with a presentation, seeking funding and explaining his team’s vision for the game – much like a Kickstarter.

“With Sony, of course I explained to them my approach, but they immediately said: ‘Go ahead, do what you gotta do.’ They offer me their trust. All the energy you need to put in the preparation of a project, I was able to focus on creating. This makes a real difference,” he said.

Earlier this week, Sony told VG247 it has no desire to pull the reins in on Kojima’s creative vision with Death Stranding.

We know next to nothing about Death Stranding at this point, other than what was gleaned by the teaser video starring a nude Daryl Dixon Norman Reedus washed on shore, a tiny baby attached by a cord to his navel, and surrounded by dying crabs due to what appears to be an oil spill.

It was definitely odd, but interesting, and 100% Kojima. And then there’s the enigmatic hints he has tossed out pertaining to the title. Everything we know so far on Death Stranding can be found through here. And again, it’s not much.

The next game from Kojima Productions is in development for PC and PlayStation 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279482-87c98c543100e2cbc093c76fb818b481.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002474 00000000000 014777  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        OTTAWA — Canada imposed Monday a fresh round of sanctions on Syria targeting the central bank and seven cabinet ministers in a bid to halt President Bashar al-Assad’s deadly crackdown on dissent.

The Canadian embassy in Damascus and a consulate also were shuttered and Canadian diplomats left the country, the foreign affairs ministry said.

The new sanctions brought the total number of individuals facing an asset freeze and a prohibition on economic dealings to 115. Canada has also designated another 39 entities.

“The continuing, appalling violence perpetrated by the Assad regime on the people of Syria compels us to again tighten the vice on those responsible,” Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said in a statement.

“These additional measures include a complete ban on the provision or acquisition of financial or other related services, as well as sanctions on the Syrian central bank and seven high-ranking Syrian officials implicated in the violence.”

The Syrian officials targeted by the new sanctions — the sixth round imposed by Ottawa since May — are Assad’s ministers of health, presidential affairs, communications, resources, industry, education and transportation.

The Assad regime has been battling a year-long uprising that has left more than 7,500 people dead, according to the United Nations.                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279504-d0c3517acadeab9072c855f8bd2e6c78.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007403 00000000000 015343  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell discussed President Obama’s speech at Hiroshima, where he said, “death fell from the sky,” and where he hoped for a nuclear-free world. It was the first time a sitting president had visited the city, which we decimated in one of two atomic bombings during World War II that ended with Japan surrendering to the United States, ending humanity’s most destructive war.

Mitchell referenced the work of former U.S. Senators Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Sam Nunn (D-GA) for their work in trying to curb the spread of nuclear material, where Brian Williams added that we used nuclear weapons against Japan “in anger” (via NewsBusters):

ANDREA MITCHELL: And Brian, just a word to two men that you knew very well, Dick Lugar and Sam Nunn, the fact that they had this nuclear threat initiative and that they controlled through a bipartisan act of Congress, controlled the spread of nuclear materials, non-state actors and materials even in this age of terror, all these decades after the end of the Cold War is just remarkable and I don't think they get enough credit for it. BRIAN WILLIAMS: It is and that is still the threat that people worry about that this material will fall into the wrong hands. If people have found the U.S. to be preachy in the years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki about the use of weapons, it’s because we’re the only nation to have used them in anger. Sometimes, I am amazed that the world has been without these weapons all the years since, but it is a point of, a great pride by the people who have seen to it.

Mitchell then thanked Williams, and NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss, for “helping us understanding the context better.” Beschloss had compared Obama’s speech to John F. Kennedy’s 1963 address at American University. Both the United States and the then-Soviet Union were discussing whether to implement a nuclear test ban treaty.

Yet, the notion that anger was seemingly the primary motivating factor in dropping atomic bombs is nonsense. We did it to end the war. Period. Williams previously stated on the broadcast that between 300,000 to 1 million Japanese were killed in the serial and incessant bombing campaigns we conducted throughout the country prior to dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One could make the argument, like the late Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, that proportionality should have been considered prior to the use of nuclear weapons. Of course, I disagree. I’ve already written about the outrageous casualty projections made at the time by the Joint War Plans Committee for our planned ground invasion (Operation Downfall) of the island nation, which would have soared into the hundreds of thousands for our forces—and into the millions for the Japanese. The atomic bombings were conducted to save lives and end a horrible war. It was a moral act. Given that Obama’s visit has somewhat rehashed the debate as to whether nuking Japan was necessary, are liberals more disconcerted about the method in which we decided to end 262,000 Japanese lives, or is it the death toll itself?

Again, if liberals and historical revisionists are aghast at the death toll from just the atomic bombings, they seem to forget the 300,000 to a million that were killed prior to Hiroshima and Nagasaki through our sustained air campaigns. At least 100,000 men, women, and children were killed when we firebombed Tokyo in March of 1945—where’s the outrage over that act? When you take a look at the casualty estimates for the ground invasion, the very conservative ones show that over 1.2 million Japanese and American lives were saved through the atomic bombings. How is that immoral? It is not.

We should never be apologetic, hesitant, or ashamed, at using weapons at our disposal that bring wars to a swift end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279471-c7d6835eba37831bfc64d22702de9348.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005111 00000000000 015047  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        AS A JUNIOR IN 2011-12

Maxine Waters, D-Calif., to a broadcast of Russia Today for about 10 minutes Thursday.

Timothy Burke, an editor for the sports blog Deadspin, caught the bizarre broadcast switch and said RT broadcast for about 10 minutes before it switched back.

C-SPAN said it was looking into the issue.

"This afternoon the online feed for C-SPAN was briefly interrupted by RT programming," C-SPAN said.

"We are currently investigating and troubleshooting this occurrence," it added. "As RT is one of the networks we regularly monitor, we are operating under the assumption that it was an internal routing issue. If that changes we will certainly let you know."

Waters was in the middle of talking about the Securities and Exchange Commission when the switch took place.

“We don’t use the word cure very often in medicine, but this research shows that under the right circumstances this is a cure,” Dr Flora Wong said.

Dr Wong, a Monash Health neonatologist and researcher with Monash University and the Hudson Institute of Medical Research, was part of a global research project that has shown a disease that had no hopes for survival can now be treated effectively. “We now know that early and careful treatment of babies born with this rare condition can lead to survival with good long-term developmental outcomes,” Dr Wong said.

In 2009 Monash Health made medical and legal history by curing ‘Baby Z,’ who was the first baby to ever survive molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type-A, a previously incurable disease that had no prospects of survival. Babies born with the disease did not survive past early infancy.

Molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type-A is a rare condition that causes toxic sulphites to rapidly accumulate in the brain of newborns, causing seizures and the death of brain tissue, leading to death.

After Baby Z’s diagnosis with the illness, Monash Health neonatologists led by Dr Alex Veldman identified a possible treatment, cPMP (cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate). It had never before been used in humans and required unprecedented and fast-tracked legal approvals before being administered.

The treatment rapidly improved Baby Z’s sulphite (S-sulfocysteine) levels. Although she has experienced ongoing health issues, the innovative treatment allowed her to become the first human to ever survive the horrific condition. Please note that Baby Z’s identity remains supressed for legal reasons.

Data showed that S-sulfocysteine levels rapidly improve once treatment commences. The new research published now has shown that the compound is even more effective than previously thought. With earlier administration of the treatment before brain injury ensues, we have seen babies survive this illness with no significant complications whatsoever. “Because this is a rare condition we took a global approach, and treated 11 babies affected by molybdenum cofactor deficiency Type-A from around the world with the compound. It was safe, and we’ve shown that early treatment can be amazingly effective over a long time,” Dr Wong said.                                                                                         0279227-36a317776363e41a030236e8f4f628f7.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004061 00000000000 014550  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Can you name the song that connects the Beach Boys with the Rolling Stones? It is the fabulous ‘Fannie Mae’ by Buster Brown. Beach Boy, Bruce Johnston takes up the story.

“Growing up in LA, white kids weren’t listening to white radio, we were listening to KGFJ and during the day, it was an AM station and it was the radio station for the black community, it was 1000 watts. At night, we kind of caught it after school but as it got dark it went down to 250 watts, kind of like the way you’d have to kind of strain to listen to Radio Luxembourg in London or all over England. You had Etta James singing ‘You gotta roll with me Henry’, and that was really cool.”

Buster Brown: ‘Fannie Mae’ (1959)

﻿

“We listened to rhythm and blues. We listened to ‘Fannie Mae’ on Fire Records by Buster Brown…fantastic. So down the road here comes the Stones, here comes the Beach Boys, the backside of ‘Satisfaction is called ‘The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man’ but it was really the track for Fannie Mae and, for Brian and the band, the inspiration for ‘Help Me Rhonda’ in terms of the track was‘Fannie Mae’. You hear the harmonicas going da, da, da, da, da, da (Bruce sang this too). You’d be surprised at all the kind of influences we have from rhythm and blues growing up in Los Angeles.”

The Rolling Stones: ‘The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man’ (1965)

Buster Brown (15 August 1911 – 31 January 1976) played harmonica at local clubs in the 1930s and 1940. Brown moved to New York in 1956, where he was discovered by Fire Records. In 1959, aged 47, Brown recorded the rustic blues, ‘Fannie Mae’, which featured Brown’s harmonica playing and whoops, which went to No.38 in the Hot 100, and to No.1 on the R&B chart in April 1960. His remake of Louis Jordan’s ‘Is You Is or Is You Ain’t My Baby’ reached No.81 on the US pop charts later in 1960 and ‘Sugar Babe’ became his only other hit, in 1962, reaching No.19 on the R&B chart and No.99 on the pop chart .

Hear how these songs influenced ‘Help Me, Rhonda’                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279484-30ce6f8cb7f3d6ba7ae062c3eb3a6d2c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003261 00000000000 015474  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Introducing Nebulex, a fast, flexible and powerful caching library for Elixir

Caching might be one of the most common and used techniques to improve performance, and in Elixir there are different options available; some of them very good options. However, most of them are focused on local caching, but let’s face it, we seldom deploy our systems in a single node, it’s not a common scenario, specially in the Elixir/Erlang world, is it? Most of the cases we deal with distributed systems, which involves at least two nodes, therefore, sometimes a local cache might be not enough, for those cases we might also need a distributed cache, that give us not only good performance but also linear scalability, and of course, make data accessible from any node of the cluster. But you might be wondering, why not both? Why not a tool or library that give us the ability to create different caching topologies depending on our needs; it could be a simple local cache, a distributed or partitioned cache, or even a near cache topology. Well, this is where Nebulex comes in!

Nebulex is an open source caching library written in Elixir, highly inspired by Ecto, taking advantage of many of its benefits. Nebulex brings new powerful and useful features to the table, these are some of them:

Besides, Nebulex is very well documented, so the idea is you start checking out the next links and confirm by yourself how that easy it is, and of course, all mentioned features above:

At least that’s what we sports fan believe it should be like. But it’s hardly any secret that in racing your team mate is your biggest rival…

Reminds you of the 2002 Austrian GP doesn’t it? The race leader Rubbens Barichelo was ordered to make way for Michael Schumacher. That was the Ferrari policy and FIA has banned any such team orders since then.

That day, Rubbens was Michael’s biggest rival. Two of the fastest drivers, sitting in the same F2002 which is till date considered as the best F1 car Ferrari has produced. How did it matter to Ferrari even if Rubbens had gone to win the race? They would have got the same number of points for Constructors Championship. Consequences were bad that day; Michael was booed like never before; Ferrari, Michael and Rubbens were fined 1 Million dollars for not following sporting regulation on the podium, in presence of the Austrian Chancellor.

Fast forward to 2009, and I am not talking about Ferrari and F1’s silly politics this time, recollect the final laps at MotoGP held at Circuit De Catalunya. If you have missed the race or have a bad memory, watch the following video…

Play that video again and you will see that Lorenzo lost because he made the smallest of mistake, a miniscule one to be precise. He was off the defensive racing line by just 5 cm or something of that order. The footage proves that neither of them can be said to be faster than the other, they just happened to run out of corners!

That lap was Valentino Rossi’s ‘most exciting and memorable last lap ever’ and I am quoting these words as said by Rossi himself.

Jorge Lorenzo had joined team Fiat Yamaha in 2008 season, he moved up from 250cc racing to MotoGP, the final and most premiere motorcycle racing class. 2008 season opening GP, Qatar, was where Rossi realized that his strongest competition was his boyish team mate and not Stoner or Pedrosa. But many unfortunate crashes throughout the season limited Lorenzo’s ability to challenge the top riders and Rossi.

2009 is when Lorenzo proved he is faster and smarter than Rossi on more than one occasions, but again, experience does count and Rossi won his 9th world title. But something changed within the team after 2008 season. There was now a proper physical wall between the two rider’s garages!

Just take a look at the 2009 race results of Rossi & Lorenzo:

Rossi was not willing to share his bike’s setup with Lorenzo. Though the team ensured race data of both bikes was available for analysis to both riders and engineers. Going forward in 2010 season, Rossi has managed to convince Yamaha to create an entirely separate team for Lorenzo with a different team manager. This has never been done in MotoGP, Repsol Honda didn’t allow sharing of race setup in the interest of healthy competition between the riders, but Yamaha has gone one step further.

The only engineer’s who will be able to compare both set of data, are the ones sitting in Japan in the Yamaha RnD department.

Wilco Zeelenberg is Jorge Lorenzo’s team manager, and he is pretty confident about the young Spaniards bike setup capabilities and his desire to win races. He has been managing the SuperSport team till now which won in 2009, and feels it’s a good challenge to be up there and competing with the cream of motorcycle racing teams.

He reflects on Lorenzo’s capabilities, “He’s a very motivated and focused young kid and I think that’s one of his big advantages. We don’t have to motivate him, he is really eager to win. I think the first three or four races of the season will be very important – to perform well and not make mistakes. Valentino is a very experienced rider and he will take advantage of every mistake made by other riders. I think the young guys will push harder when they make a mistake, and at the fifth, sixth, seventh rounds they will push and maybe make even more mistakes. Jorge knows that he can beat anybody when everything is correct, but he should also understand that if not everything is perfect for that race he must be able to sit back and take a podium.”

Will this be the move by Rossi, much before the season has commenced?

May be, may be not!

You see, Lorenzo, till now has been riding on a bike that was mostly set-up based on Rossi’s inputs, but Lorenzo is well known for his quality to adapt to the bike. Going forward he himself will set the bike for each race. What this means is that, the fastest rider on the grid has been riding a bike that was not set-up for him from the scratch and he will be able to do the same this season.

This could very well end up in Lorenzo’s favour, he doesn’t even have to match Rossi’s setup as Lorenzo can almost ride any type of setup. He just needs to find what works for him and that may be Rossi’s nightmare.

Tests carried at Malaysia speak a lot, but should not be relied upon as the timings can be deceiving.

What needs a close watch is the tests at Qatar just prior to the season opener night race, because that’s where all the teams just fine tune their machines and will run on a setup that’s closest to the Qatar race.

But with the new engine and bike regulations, riders will follow a conservative approach to save the engine for first two races (only 6 engines are allowed per rider for 18 races, so that’s 3 races per engine), that’s where the Honda and Ducati are known to exceed past expectations of reliability.

The Fiat Yamaha team is the only team where the difference in ‘ability to win races’ between the two riders is so small, if you look at other teams there is always a dominating rider and a second one who is trying his best to compete amongst top 4.

These are the two riders who stole the show completely in 2009, and at each race! The team is where competition begins for each rider, but in case of Fiat Yamaha, their team is where the biggest rivals of MotoGP ride.

I just can’t wait to see them fight in 2010 again.

When it came time to travel to Detroit for the 2017 Woodward Dream Cruise, instead of renting the usual Hertz economy car we called our friends in Dearborn and they hooked us up with a Mustang for the week. Not just any Mustang mind you, but an EcoBoost automatic that had recently been outfitted with the full gamut of Ford Performance Racing Parts (FPRP).

The standard EcoBoost Mustang is a great car and when you stand on the gas and the boost kicks in, you’d never guess it only had four pistons under the hood. With 310 horsepower, the little 2.3L turbo four makes five more horses than the 1998-1999 Cobra that was the Mustang flag waver at the end of the previous millennium. The FPRP parts add another 25 hp and 70 lb-ft of torque to the package to make it a little more potent, but the main focus with the parts package is centered on handling and appearance.

Deep in the bowels of Detroit in our top secret photo location, the lowered White Platinum EcoBoost Mustang still wears its Milan Dragway war paint.

In the name of a power increase, FPRP added a 50-state legal calibration kit with a cold air kit and performance air filter, plus a cat-back exhaust system. The calibration kit (part no. M-9603-M4) adds that 25 hp at 5,500 rpm and 70 lb-ft at 2,200, but it also has a 40 hp and 60 lb-ft average gain from 2,500 to 5,000, and 75/64 average gain from 5,500 to 6,800. At 6,000 rpm, it’s worth 100 hp over the stock 2.3, which loses steam north of 5,000 rpm. So basically, it makes more power everywhere, which means there’s no performance compromise like you see in some aftermarket modifications. The cal kit also allows you to change the rear gear ratio up to 4.09:1 and when used with an automatic trans like in our case, it optimizes the performance shift schedule.

But the package on this car is mostly about handling, with the addition of the Track Handling Pack (part no. M-FR3A-M8, $1,520) that has pre-assembled struts (no spring compressor required to install), lowering springs that lowers the car an inch, upper strut mounts, jounce bumper kit, sway bar kit, rear toe links, and toe link to knuckle bearings. The Handling Pack fits 2015-2017 GT and 2.3L EcoBoost coupes and in Ford’s words, “Gives a more aggressive-looking stance with a focus on handling and on-track performance.” The stiffer springs and shock/strut valving does make the ride a little bit harsher, but not in a bad way—it’s totally comfortable even on Detroit’s horrible, pock-marked road surfaces.

The FPRP parts add 25 hp to the 2.3L EcoBoost and a whopping 100 hp near redline.

There are also some appearance related mods, such as unique wheel center caps, a radiator cover, Ford Performance badge, and a Ford Performance windshield banner that when combined with the aggressive-but-not-annoying exhaust note let everyone know this isn’t a standard EcoBoost Mustang. In Detroit, already a car-centric town especially during the yearly Woodward Dream Cruise, this White Platinum Mustang got more looks than we expected. I guess Detroiters know the factory hot rods when they see them.

Milan Dragway is a short drive from Detroit, so after covering the Mustang Memories show at Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn, we headed up there with Courtney Barber and her Project Road Warrior 1965 Mustang to face off against each other, just for fun. It wasn’t a true drag test, since we didn’t air down the tires or ice the intake, and barely had time to tech in before the fist round so the car was still hot from the drive up. So, it was more for fun than anything and the ETs reflect that. Plus it was a hot and humid Michigan summer day, not at all ideal for a day at the dragstrip when in search of good numbers.

The calibration pack includes a cold air intake with filter and different engine calibration for the power increase.

Motor Trend’s numbers on a 2016 EcoBoost Mustang with a manual trans showed 14.5 seconds at 98 mph in the quarter-mile, and on this hot day at Milan with a totally un-prepped car, our FPRP-modified Mustang was about a half-second slower than MT’s tester. Also remember, the suspension package is aimed at handling improvements, which always detracts from the weight transfer and suspension action optimum for the drag strip. So don’t look at our numbers as a realistic measure of the FPRP parts—if we had more time to conduct a true test, it would have been noticeably quicker.

In summary, it was a sweet ride for the Dream Cruise, and the FPRP parts make a difference you can hear and feel. The performance suspension made the car nice and solid to drive, and in hindsight we should have made our track day on the road course at Gingerman instead of Milan to really get a feel for the FPRP parts. Next time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279390-4e6a64d172651a635f9354dff67bab41.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000017606 00000000000 015057  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The radical right caught fire last year, as broad-based populist anger at political, demographic and economic changes in America ignited an explosion of new extremist groups and activism across the nation.

Hate groups stayed at record levels — almost 1,000 — despite the total collapse of the second largest neo-Nazi group in America. Furious anti-immigrant vigilante groups soared by nearly 80%, adding some 136 new groups during 2009. And, most remarkably of all, so-called "Patriot" groups — militias and other organizations that see the federal government as part of a plot to impose “one-world government” on liberty-loving Americans — came roaring back after years out of the limelight.

The anger seething across the American political landscape — over racial changes in the population, soaring public debt and the terrible economy, the bailouts of bankers and other elites, and an array of initiatives by the relatively liberal Obama Administration that are seen as "socialist" or even "fascist" — goes beyond the radical right. The "tea parties" and similar groups that have sprung up in recent months cannot fairly be considered extremist groups, but they are shot through with rich veins of radical ideas, conspiracy theories and racism.

“We are in the midst of one of the most significant right-wing populist rebellions in United States history,” Chip Berlet, a veteran analyst of the American radical right, wrote earlier this year. "We see around us a series of overlapping social and political movements populated by people [who are] angry, resentful, and full of anxiety. They are raging against the machinery of the federal bureaucracy and liberal government programs and policies including health care, reform of immigration and labor laws, abortion, and gay marriage."

Sixty-one percent of Americans believe the country is in decline, according to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Just a quarter think the government can be trusted. And the anti-tax tea party movement is viewed in much more positive terms than either the Democratic or Republican parties, the poll found.

The signs of growing radicalization are everywhere. Armed men have come to Obama speeches bearing signs suggesting that the "tree of liberty" needs to be "watered" with "the blood of tyrants." The Conservative Political Action Conference held this February was co-sponsored by groups like the John Birch Society, which believes President Eisenhower was a Communist agent, and Oath Keepers, a Patriot outfit formed last year that suggests, in thinly veiled language, that the government has secret plans to declare martial law and intern patriotic Americans in concentration camps. Politicians pandering to the antigovernment right in 37 states have introduced "Tenth Amendment Resolutions," based on the constitutional provision keeping all powers not explicitly given to the federal government with the states. And, at the "A Well Regulated Militia" website, a recent discussion of how to build "clandestine safe houses" to stay clear of the federal government included a conversation about how mass murderers like Timothy McVeigh and Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph were supposedly betrayed at such houses.

Doing the Numbers

The number of hate groups in America has been going up for years, rising 54% between 2000 and 2008 and driven largely by an angry backlash against non-white immigration and, starting in the last year of that period, the economic meltdown and the climb to power of an African American president.

According to the latest annual count by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), these groups rose again slightly in 2009 — from 926 in 2008 to 932 last year — despite the demise of a key neo-Nazi group. The American National Socialist Workers Party, which had 35 chapters in 28 states, imploded shortly after the October 2008 arrest of founder Bill White for making threats against his enemies.

At the same time, the number of what the SPLC designates as "nativist extremist" groups — organizations that go beyond mere advocacy of restrictive immigration policy to actually confront or harass suspected immigrants — jumped from 173 groups in 2008 to 309 last year. Virtually all of these vigilante groups have appeared since the spring of 2005.

But the most dramatic story by far has been with the antigovernment Patriots.

The militias and the larger Patriot movement first came to Americans’ attention in the mid-1990s, when they appeared as an angry reaction to what was seen as a tyrannical government bent on crushing all dissent. Sparked most dramatically by the death of 76 Branch Davidians during a 1993 law enforcement siege in Waco, Texas, those who joined the militias also railed against the Democratic Clinton Administration and initiatives like gun control and environmental regulation. Although the Patriot movement included people formerly associated with racially based hate groups, it was above all animated by a view of the federal government as the primary enemy, along with a fondness for antigovernment conspiracy theories. By early this decade, the groups had largely disappeared from public view.

But last year, as noted in the SPLC’s August report, "The Second Wave: Return of the Militias," a dramatic resurgence in the Patriot movement and its paramilitary wing, the militias, began. Now, the latest SPLC count finds that an astonishing 363 new Patriot groups appeared in 2009, with the totals going from 149 groups (including 42 militias) to 512 (127 of them militias) — a 244% jump.

That is cause for grave concern. Individuals associated with the Patriot movement during its 1990s heyday produced an enormous amount of violence, most dramatically the Oklahoma City bombing that left 168 people dead.

Already there are signs of similar violence emanating from the radical right. Since the installation of Barack Obama, right-wing extremists have murdered six law enforcement officers. Racist skinheads and others have been arrested in alleged plots to assassinate the nation’s first black president. One man from Brockton, Mass. — who told police he had learned on white supremacist websites that a genocide was under way against whites — is charged with murdering two black people and planning to kill as many Jews as possible on the day after Obama’s inauguration. Most recently, a rash of individuals with antigovernment, survivalist or racist views have been arrested in a series of bomb cases.

As the movement has exploded, so has the reach of its ideas, aided and abetted by commentators and politicians in the ostensible mainstream. While in the 1990s, the movement got good reviews from a few lawmakers and talk-radio hosts, some of its central ideas today are being plugged by people with far larger audiences like FOX News’ Glenn Beck and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn). Beck, for instance, re-popularized a key Patriot conspiracy theory — the charge that FEMA is secretly running concentration camps — before finally “debunking” it.

Last year also experienced levels of cross-pollination between different sectors of the radical right not seen in years. Nativist activists increasingly adopted the ideas of the Patriots; racist rants against Obama and others coursed through the Patriot movement; and conspiracy theories involving the government appeared in all kinds of right-wing venues. A good example is the upcoming Second Amendment March in Washington, D.C. The website promoting the march is topped by a picture of a colonial militiaman, and key supporters include Larry Pratt, a long-time militia enthusiast with connections to white supremacists, and Richard Mack, a conspiracy-mongering former sheriff associated with the Patriot group Oath Keepers.

What may be most noteworthy about the march, however, is its date — April 19. That is the date of the first shots fired at Lexington in the Revolutionary War. And it is also the anniversary of the fiery end of the government siege in Waco and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.                                                                                                                          0279496-d1ba8d8bd88623ed5e26a61ff0c9f5f4.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003117 00000000000 015366  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Keeper are from the US and Sea Bastard are from the UK. Both bands play Doom and contribute a single track to this split.

Keeper are up first with 777, clocking in at almost 14 minutes.

777 is crushingly repetitive Sludge Doom with acerbic, toxic screams that tear through the meaty guitars like a serrated blade through flesh.

This is a song that glorifies the heavy riff, slows it down and then makes it even thicker than normal through some form of arcane jiggery-pokery. Yes, that’s the term.

Imagine Khanate if they had the structure of Electric Wizard. Agonizingly delectable.

Uncompromisingly bleak, Keeper show that they mean business and easily have what it takes to join the big leagues of filthy, hateful Doom.

The wonderfully named Sea Bastard are next with Astral Rebirth, which is almost 21 minutes long.

Astral Rebirth is another lumbering behemoth of a song. Long, slow and heavy; Sea Bastard have come to flatten everything.

Imagine Bongripper if they had deep growling/high screaming vocals and you’ll be in the general area.

This is another song that is relentlessly heavy and is crushingly repetitive; flowing tsunamis of heavy guitars seem to repeatedly peak and crash on the listener. The Doom is huge and we love it this way.

Not content with just playing slow, the pace does pick up but the feeling of being compressed down by an immense weight never leaves. Heaviness is in their DNA.

Both bands to an excellent job of their time on this split and if you’re looking for a good introduction to some top quality Doom then look no further.

Highly recommended.

Updated

The New South Wales Health Minister has admitted the Government will struggle to meet its target of reducing child obesity rates by 5 per cent over the next decade.

This follows a report released last week by the Department of Health that concluded that obesity is becoming "normalised" in the state.

A snapshot found that:

22 per cent of the state's children are overweight or obese

5 per cent eat enough vegetables

64 per cent eat enough fruit

28 per cent get sufficient exercise

44 per cent spend more than two hours a day on a sedentary activity

Health Minister Jillian Skinner said parents were finding it more difficult to identify that their children have a problem.

"Generally everyone has put on weight so it changes what you see," she said.

Reducing rates of childhood obesity was one of 12 priorities for the Government identified by Premier Mike Baird.

"It is a tall order but if you don't have aspirational targets then you don't try hard enough," Ms Skinner said.

Director of Preventative Health Professor Chris Rissel said the Government was targeting a range of programs to encourage exercise and a better diet, such as the installation of iced water bubblers in schools.

"We want to make healthy normal. So that people do healthy things as normal behaviour and not default to the junk food option," he said.

"The messages are about increasing physical activity. It is about eating a modest amount and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption," he said.

The vice president of the NSW Australian Medical Association Dr Kean-Seng Lim is a GP from the western Sydney suburb of Mount Druitt, where he says in some age groups 50 per cent of young people are overweight.

"If you see everyone around you being the same weight then that becomes the new norm," he said.

At his surgery he trains locals about how to shop better, using an animation that describes what food they should buy at the supermarket.

They are warned that obese children usually become obese adults.

"That is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, an increased risk of heart disease and an increase in all causes of mortality," he said.

"We're in the top end of obesity rates in the world."

Sometime during All Things Considered, the evening news broadcast, there is another sound, unrelated to Reagan or hijackings or abortion clinics. A horse whinnies. And then the sound of a barn—jangling tack and boots walking on concrete—fades in.

“Okay, what’s your horse’s name?” a woman asks in a chipper, expectant tone. Off mic, a different woman answers, muffled. And then a man’s voice comes in, strong and certain, with a Western, tough-guy accent: “They call me Christopher.”

For the next four and a half minutes, the woman, an animal communicator, reads the mind of the horse, Christopher, speaking aloud into the microphone. “Tell me about times when you’re happy,” she says.

“Well, I like to run in open country and jump,” the horse says. Christopher sounds melancholy; he misses wherever he came from. “It rained last week. The rain always does this to me.” The communicator misunderstands: she thinks the horse loves the beach. “No, no, no the ocean’s fine, I like it,” Christopher explains. But it’s the mountains he really loves.

“This guy is really something else,” the communicator laughs. “He wants to wear bells!”

She hasn’t heard quite right, again. “I’m thinking of canyons and lightning,” the horse says. “I’m wet. Running against the dark sky. And there is nothing more free than this. The earth is ringing. And I believe I can fly.”

“He’s happy,” the communicator says.

A long moment, the sounds of the barn, a stretch of quiet makes the listener wonder if the horse really is happy.

“Okay?” she asks, a bit less chipper, finished with her job. The recorder turns off. The news fades in.

I first heard “Communicating with Horses” in 2008, sitting in a cold room in Portland, Maine, with a handful of other aspiring radio producers at the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies. We listened closely, unsure where to look. We screwed up our faces, confused. The freedom of the piece was what struck me the most; I remember thinking it was so profoundly weird. There was no real narrative thrust. The piece used real tape—the woman was an actual animal communicator—but it also used elements of fiction and theater that were outside the rules of radio as I had understood them. It was the mid-2000s public-radio equivalent of hearing Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring in 1913. No one screamed or hurled fruit at the speakers, but we were disturbed: Was this allowed?

Although National Public Radio was founded fifteen years before “Communicating with Horses” aired, the people who worked there were still trying to figure out, in 1985, what exactly public radio was. Funded by micro-grants and public money, spurred on by open-minded programmers, public radio in its early days was something of a wide-open medium that could be almost anything. “The spirit there was adventurous, experimental, artistic, and dedicated to the medium of recorded sound,” Jay Allison, who produced “Communicating with Horses,” told me. “Also, no one was listening. The stakes were low.”

National Public Radio started in Washington, D.C., but like the Works Progress Administration in the thirties, it was a hybrid between a top-down federal project and a grassroots local one. Audio producers from local stations across the country helped to imagine public radio into existence, making stories in Alaska, Maine, Utah, California, and all the towns in between that were then played to millions on All Things Considered. Jay Allison called these early producers a “motley band”—they were just making it all up as they went along.

In 1973, Allison lived in D.C., where he stayed in collective housing and raced motorcycles. He was out of work and at loose ends when a guy named Keith Talbot, an innovative radio producer who was helping to build the sound of early public radio, came over for dinner and said, You guys oughta come work at this new thing called NPR, this new thing on M Street.

At the time, the building was a dump. There were reel-to-reel players everywhere and corkboards with handwritten notes. People didn’t use headphones as much as they do now, so it was loud. Producers played the same five seconds of sound over and over again to cut it just in the right place. No one I talked to remembered if the building had windows. “I always thought of it as a mosh pit,” Davia Nelson, of the early public-radio duo the Kitchen Sisters, told me.

When Jay Allison showed up, one thing the building definitely didn’t have was security. He was never technically employed at NPR, but no one seemed to notice, and he regularly borrowed a recorder to report stories on. “It was just like a key to the universe,” he told me. “It allowed me to satisfy my curiosity about everything.”

The people who worked at NPR had come from all over—Pacifica Radio, the arts, journalism. “All of us were just trying to impress each other,” Allison said. “Trying to get the rest of the gang to say ‘listen to that!’ ” The work was wild and loose, earnest and bizarre. It reflected a spirit of service central to NPR’s mission—the public part of public radio that meant it was funded by listeners, grants, and the government, and was accountable to citizens rather than bottom lines.

Two of NPR’s most influential and experimental leading producers were Nikki Silva and Davia Nelson, who started making audio pieces as the Kitchen Sisters in the late seventies in Santa Cruz. They played clips of oral histories they had recorded on their live community radio-station broadcast. “We went out and recorded hours and hours and hours with people, and then got back to the studio and quickly realized that nobody was going to listen to eight hours of tape.” They learned to cut the tape and piece it back together using razor blades and splicing tape. A friend told them about NPR, but they had never listened to it when they sent their first piece in. A few weeks later, the producer Alex Chadwick called and said, We really like your piece, but what kind of equipment are you girls using?

Largely self-taught, Nelson and Silva composed their pieces as much as they produced them, primarily because, at first, they didn’t realize they could start and stop as they went along. “It was just us and the machines, and the machines seemed to have a life of their own. I think of us standing by each other kind of dancing together with the machine. It was like a living animal.” The work they make is almost always nonnarrated, character driven, and rich in sound. They weren’t making Aristotelian This American Life narrative arcs but rather cinema-verité slice-of-life pieces that take the listener deep into a corner of the world they hadn’t known before: an all-girls radio station in Tennessee, an ad hoc kitchen in a solitary-confinement cell, a smoky bar with a one-armed pool player.

It was late December in 1981 when the Kitchen Sisters’ piece “Tupperware” aired on All Things Considered. “Somewhere in the world, a Tupperware party is held every ten seconds,” the piece begins, and then soars into a cacophony of nonnarrated sound collage of Tupperware parties, rallies, and voices. Women sing songs about Tupperware in four-part harmony, someone drums out a beat on the plastic lids, and the voices of Tupperware saleswomen cut in and out—stories of women who have found a way to make money from home, who have discovered female community not in the consciousness raisings of their hippie sisters but in the comfort of domestic commerce.

A guy named Scott Carrier heard “Tupperware,” and the other strange sounds of early public radio, shortly after his marriage fell apart. He was looking for a way out of despair. Carrier had studied film in college but had given it up because it was too expensive. Listening to the Kitchen Sisters showed him another medium that was accessible, experimental, and political. “They were able to present a slice of life that was their own vision,” he told me. “No one was telling them how to do that story. There was no sponsorship; they had freedom. Truly independent producers are dangerous. Radio is dangerous. The first thing revolutionary armies do is take over the radio stations.” In 1983, Carrier wrote a letter to NPR to tell them he was hitchhiking to Washington, D.C., thinking he would record people on his way, make a nonnarrated vérité piece about the open road, then convince NPR to play it when he arrived.

When he got to M Street, NPR had finally hired a security guard, who wouldn’t let him through. But Carrier talked his way in, convincing the guard to call up to the studio. The producers let him up as a joke, to see how crazy he was, but they liked his audio and helped him make his first piece. With a team of producers and engineers, Carrier developed a new style of personal-essay radio, one that defied easy narratives or news pegs.

The piece that came out of his journey across the U.S. is long and rambling, and the recordings aren’t great, but the voices he captured are uncanny and haunting. In March of 1983, a listener would have clicked on the radio hoping to hear an update about Reagan’s plans for what the media was calling “Star Wars.” Instead she would have heard the whoosh of tires, the voice of a hospital intern in North Carolina trying to figure out how to care about all his patients, the sound of a man taking swigs of whiskey as he drives to Florida to see his mom one last time before she dies, and the voice of Scott Carrier describing the light bounce of the red rocks of Arizona.

I grew up on nineties public radio, listening to All Things Considered as my mom cooked dinner and to Car Talk as I ran errands with my dad on Saturday mornings. Before I went to Salt, I listened to the radio to get myself from point A to point B. I listened to Nina Totenberg narrate the Supreme Court as I drove to the grocery store; I laughed along to the Garrison Keillor joke show while I cleaned my apartment. Radio has always been a multitasker’s medium: you can do your chores and get the week’s news; cook dinner for the kids and get a deeper understanding of the financial crisis. It rarely demands your full attention.

It was during these years that NPR started to become more of a news outlet than a space for vérité documentary or experimentation. The producers and executives wanted their listeners to be able to trust them, and accuracy and gravity became crucial. Pieces needed to be short, relevant, and have a strong sense of momentum. If a segment was going to be on All Things Considered, there had to be a news hook. If it was going to be on a magazine show, it needed a strong narrative arc. Once, I heard an editor at a radio conference say that she wouldn’t accept a pitch unless the story made her run down the hall screaming, Oh my God! It was a high bar that left out a lot of stories, including sound-rich pieces on Tupperware and animal communicators. “When I got there, we were toddlers,” Jay Allison told me, “and then [we had] sort of teenage rebellion, and then finally [we became] grown-ups. Grown-ups don’t play in the same way.”

Though this era of radio was well-loved by Midwestern, middle-class people like me and my parents, it was hated by many others. Saturday Night Live poked fun at NPR’s placid, colorless vibe with its “Delicious Dish” sketches, which satirized the repressed, dulcet, careful sound of nineties public radio. Writer Charles Bowden had more precision and acidity in his distaste: “The voice is educated, smug, and more or less female,” he wrote in the mid-aughts. “That fabled NPR voice, produced in some secret kitchen where ordinary Americans are dipped in tubs of soy milk, white wine, and herbal tea until their vocal cords lose all sense of desire, familiarity, or place.” Bowden sums up the worst stereotypes of public radio—impotent and stuck-up, bourgeois, and relentlessly white. Although public radio was never as one-note as that stereotype, even during the most grown-up years, as Allison might call them, there was always something about the critiques that cut to the quick.

Experimentation survived during the early years of This American Life, where Scott Carrier started airing his documentaries and essays. The Kitchen Sisters still aired short pieces on All Things Considered—between much longer segments of serious news. But those were the stories that grabbed me by the collar, demanded my attention, and asked me to leave my chores for later. Those weird, sound-rich, nonnarrative pieces were the ones that made me want to make radio. I remember listening to a piece on This American Life about a man who had started a cable TV channel that only showed puppy videos. I found a CD full of radio documentaries at the public library that used audio diaries to tell the story of a young woman struggling with anorexia. These voices generated a deep intimacy, a kind that I’ve never experienced in any other medium. The producers and the characters were speaking to me directly—across the ether, as they used to say.

*

Recently, I’ve started to think of those early years of NPR as the time of the old, weird public radio, a phrase Greil Marcus used to describe the America captured by Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music, a set of albums that came out in 1952 and helped to spur the folk music revival and give a sound and cultural ethos to a new era of leftist politics. Smith himself was a grade A bohemian weirdo, an experimental filmmaker who lived at the Chelsea Hotel in the seventies. He kept enormous collections of Ukrainian Easter eggs, string figures, and Seminole texts, and dabbled liberally in the occult. He also had a great record collection, which he curated into the anthology.

The Anthology of American Folk Music was full of performances by the Carter Family and Blind Lemon Jefferson and field recordings by Alan Lomax and other collectors. There are hymns and sacred harp singers and the songs of chain gangs and workers. There are murderers and ghosts and an eerie spirituality that permeates everything. Cuckoo birds foretell tragedy and old ladies do battle with the devil. The world the anthology invokes doesn’t make a lot of literal sense, but it does make a deep, poetic sense, a sense that comes from building on centuries of tradition and making art when no one is really looking.

NPR in the early days dealt in that same kind of poetic sense. The motley crew of radio producers on M Street and in Santa Cruz and at the stations that dotted the prairies and mountains created work that allowed for the weirdness of America to live on the airwaves. Producers went out and recorded voices of everyday people, people who drove trucks and played pool and sold Tupperware. They used those voices to experiment with sound and create work that unsettled you. The familiar became strange; the mundane became poetic. Like Marcus’s Old Weird America, the Old Weird Public Radio was populist experimentation. The result was shows that radically reoriented the listener to the world they lived in, that helped them hear America anew.

We are in an audio renaissance, a revival if you will. We call it podcasting now instead of radio, and it has opened things up, invited people in, created an audience public radio never had. The public-service mission that inspired Jay Allison has faded away as the financial structure of audio storytelling has switched from pledge drives to corporate sponsorship, and podcasts compete for top billing on the iTunes charts. Some of the danger that Scott Carrier heard in “Tupperware” has become safe. But there are more diverse voices in my earbuds than there ever were on the public-radio waves, and more topics covered than ever could have been possible on the radio’s small bandwidth. There is still a lot of possibility in the form.

But I can’t help but long for the far-out sounds of the old, weird public radio. I crave strange voices coming to me when I turn my radio on at just the right moment. I miss being captivated by the intimacy of a voice that I didn’t expect to hear. I miss wanting to throw fruit at a speaker because of the utter strangeness of the sounds coming at me, like I felt like doing with “Communicating with Horses.” And I miss audio that critiques the world in both content and form, giving me access to the deep, strange psychology of Evangelical truck drivers in Texas, and Tupperware salespeople in Salinas, and animal communicators in the mid-Atlantic—people whose narratives don’t follow the rules, whose stories won’t be the ones that top iTunes ratings, and whose lives won’t make you scream, Oh my God!

Larry Hogan signed an executive order Monday that requires all firms with state contracts to promise they will not boycott Israel.

Hogan, surrounded by local and national Jewish leaders, said he wants to send a message that Maryland supports the Jewish state and the economic ties between the two regions.

The executive order is meant to thwart the international, Palestinian-led Boycott, ,Divestment and Sanctions movement, which urges companies to refuse to do business in Israel. The effort has gained only modest support in the United States.

Pro-Israel groups across the country have been pushing states to enact such anti-BDS measures, though the legality of some have been challenged on free-speech grounds.

Hogan said all future state contracts would require companies to certify they will not economically discriminate against Israel, and that if any current state contractors refuse to agree, “they would be terminated.”

“There is no place in our state for boycotts and threats,” Hogan said.

The order appears largely symbolic. The administration could not identify any current contractors engaged in a boycott.

“I don’t believe that there are,” Hogan said.

The order mirrors legislation introduced, but not passed, earlier this year. That bill also would have forbid the state from investing pension funds in any companies that boycott Israel.

More than 20 states have passed anti-BDS legislation or executive orders.

The BDS movement has gained support among Palestinian advocates, some mainstream Protestant groups and some left-leaning Jewish organizations that object to the policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Supporters of Hogan’s move says it echoes the state’s “Declaration of Cooperation” signed by Gov. William Donald Schaefer in 1988 that promised mutual economic support between Israel and Maryland.

The order was enthusiastically embraced by Jewish leaders, who view the BDS movement as an effort to undermine the Jewish state.

It comes about a year before Hogan faces re-election in 2018.

“It is extremely important to the Jewish community to see a governor willing to stand up for Israel,” said Howard Libit, executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council. “This is as strong a statement as a governor can make, and we are thrilled.”

Critics of anti-BDS legislation, including the American Civil Liberties Union, say that boycotts are a protected form of expression. The ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on Oct. 11 contending that a similar law in Kansas unconstitutionally violates the First Amendment.

In that case, a teacher who had personally chosen to boycott Israeli products in protest of the treatment of Palestinians was denied a state job training other math teachers.

In Texas last week, the city of Dickinson cited that state’s anti-BDS law, and refused to give out Hurricane Harvey relief grants to residents who supported a boycott of Israel.

During an Annapolis news conference, Hogan dismissed First Amendment concerns, saying any boycott of Israel was discriminatory on its face.

“They’re asking people to discriminate against Israel,” Hogan said of the BDS movement. “There’s no argument to the contrary that makes any sense.”

The executive order, which Hogan signed immediately after announcing his plans, is not the first time Maryland has withheld state money from companies engaged in international disputes.

In 2012, the General Assembly passed a law that said companies investing $20 million or more in Iran’s energy sector would be barred from doing business with Maryland. The state identified 22 firms disqualified from Maryland contracts, but none of those firms was working with the state.

Alan S. Ronkin, regional director for the AJC: Global Jewish Advocacy, said people are free to say what they want about Israel. But, he added, “the state is free to do business with companies that reflect its values.”

State Sen. Bobby Zirkin of Baltimore County and Del. Benjamin F. Kramer of Montgomery County introduced the anti-BDS legislation that failed to pass this year. The men, both Democrats and Jewish, said Monday the were evaluating whether to introduce a bill next year to bar the state from investing pension money in companies participating in the BDS movement.

Zirkin said companies that target Israel are also hurting the economic fortunes of Maryland, and the state has a right to protect its interests.

“Everyone has a right to an opinion, including the state of Maryland.”

Dubbed a “sequel” to a similar 2016 effort, the latest study found 5,556 voters were “quietly removed” from the records for reasons related to non-citizenship “between 2011 and May 2017,” according to an advanced look at the findings provided by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (PILF). Of the total registered, one-third of unlawful voters managed to cast ballots—leading to a total of more than 7,400 illegal votes cast, according to the report.

The organization points out that it was unable to find any evidence that illegal registrations or votes were ever prosecuted.

The report details how ineligible individuals are slowly discovered by local officials—most often, the authors allege, by accident. Applicants for voter registration are not required to prove they are actual U.S. citizens in Virginia. The vast majority of states only require that people claim to be citizens during registration, PILF notes. The report details, however, that Virginia shares information when a claimed citizen indicates otherwise to a separate state agency. At that point, removal procedures begin:

In the absence of regular data-sharing arrangements between federal officials and the Commonwealth, the ability of election officials to identify aliens on the voter rolls is almost nonexistent. The most that happens in Virginia is that an alien on the voter rolls will sometimes tell the state DMV they are not a citizen. Without those leads, counties and municipalities must accept false claims of citizenship on their face.

The authors also shared with this reporter examples of how some ineligible noncitizens admitted their immigration statuses at the outset, but were still registered to vote. Some illegal registrants lasted on the rolls for years–risking possible deportation–until they were discovered.

In order to obtain the information necessary to perform the study, the Public Interest Legal Foundation filed a total of three lawsuits across the commonwealth in 2016. The group claims that political interference from officials loyal to Governor Terry McAuliffe (D) initially stalled the research effort.

“At the instruction of Governor McAuliffe’s political appointees, local election officials spent countless resources to prevent this information from spilling into the open,” J. Christian Adams, a former Department of Justice attorney and President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation said in a statement. “Virginia hid critical information that would have improved election integrity while a political operative-turned-governor vetoed numerous proposals that would’ve prevented alien registration and voting.”

A release notes that local clerks were advised to reject PILF’s requests for information, citing the federal Drivers Privacy Protection Act as a justification to prevent full disclosure, since some noncitizens outed themselves when receiving driver’s licenses. That effort reportedly failed when the organization sued some northern and central Virginia officials.

The “alien voting” report arrives at an interesting time. In addition the presidential commission announced that plans to study similar problems around the country, Virginia is also due to hold statewide elections in November 2017.

The nonprofit law firm credits the Virginia Voters Alliance for assisting in the research effort locally.

The report adds that it is a felony on both state and federal levels for a non-citizen to vote and can carry with it an order of deportation.

For the 2007 horror film, see Forest of the Dead (film)

"Forest of the Dead" is the ninth episode of the fourth series of British science fiction television series Doctor Who. It was first broadcast by BBC One on 7 June 2008.[1] It is the second of a two-part story; the first part, "Silence in the Library", aired on 31 May.

In the episode, the time-travelling temp Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) is trapped inside a virtual reality in a planet-sized library's hard drive in the 51st century and has false memories implanted of a married life. At the same time, another time traveller, the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant), seeks to rescue Donna, and thousands of other humans saved inside the library hard drive while being pursued by the microscopic swarm called Vashta Nerada. The episode also features the death of River Song (Alex Kingston) an archaeologist who has a close relationship with the Doctor, but because of the non-linearity of this partnership, the Doctor in the episode has only just met River.

Plot [ edit ]

The Tenth Doctor, River Song, Strackman Lux, and the remainder of their team flee the Vashta Nerada, microscopic carnivorous creatures that are thriving in the shadows of a planet-sized Library. Other team members are consumed by the Vashta Nerada, their suits and skeletons animated by the creatures who then chase down the survivors. During a respite, Lux explains that the Library was constructed by his grandfather for Lux's aunt, Charlotte Abigail Lux, who was diagnosed with an incurable disease at a young age. Lux's grandfather had a giant computer (CAL, from Charlotte's initials) constructed at the core of the Library to allow Charlotte's mind to live on among the collected works of humankind. The Doctor realises CAL represents Charlotte's mind, struggling to cope after "saving" the thousands of patrons by transferring their consciousnesses to the computer core when the Vashta Nerada attacked. Even the virus checker program housed in the Library's moon, nicknamed "Doctor Moon", is having difficulties helping CAL maintain control.

Within the simulation, an apparently normal contemporary Earth village, a trapped Donna Noble is tended to by Dr. Moon and introduced to Lee, whom she marries and with whom she raises two children. Aware that time seems to be skipping in the simulation, Donna is alerted to its computerised nature by Miss Evangelista, one of River's team members killed by the Vashta Nerada. Her corrupted consciousness makes her appear deformed, but allows her to see the reality for what it is. Donna returns home questioning her reality, which results in her children disappearing, much to her horror.

The Vashta Nerada inhabit the suit as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.

The Doctor, River and the others descend to the core. The Doctor attempts to talk with the Vashta Nerada. He learns that their home, forests from a different planet, were used to create the books of the Library. They now claim the Library as their own. The Doctor demands that he be allowed to free the people trapped in the computer core, including Donna, after which the Library will belong to the Vashta Nerada. The creatures agree and permit them one day. The Doctor prepares to hook himself to the computer terminal, aware this will likely kill him. River knocks him out, handcuffs him to a pillar, and takes his place. The Doctor tries to stop her, but River insists that his death now would prevent her meeting him in her own past. River refuses to tell him who she is before activating the interface, much to the Doctor's anguish. As River initiates the connection, the simulation starts to fall apart. Donna finds herself slipping away from Lee as the simulation fades to white.

The patrons stored inside the computer rematerialise on the Library surface, and Lux evacuates them to transport ships. Separately, Donna and Lee attempt to find each other but fail to do so, leaving Donna heartbroken. As they prepare to leave the Library forever, the Doctor and Donna leave behind River's diary and sonic screwdriver, but the Doctor still wonders why his future self would give River his screwdriver. Running back to it, he finds a data recorder inside the mechanism which has preserved River's data ghost. He races down to the core and uploads her pattern before it dissipates. River wakes up in the Earth simulation and is greeted by Charlotte and River's team members who had fallen victim to the Vashta Nerada (including Miss Evangelista, who is no longer deformed). Charlotte assures her that the Earth simulation is now a "good place" where she will be safe as the Doctor fixed the data core.

The Doctor then goes back to the TARDIS and snaps his fingers to see if what River had said earlier - that she'd seen a future Doctor "swagger back to his TARDIS and open the doors with a snap of his fingers" - would really work. The TARDIS opens with Donna waiting inside. He snaps his fingers to close it as we see River in the Earth simulation reading her diary to her children.

Continuity [ edit ]

According to Steven Moffat, the squareness gun used by Professor River Song to help the party escape from the impending Vashta Nerada at the beginning of the episode is intended to be the same sonic blaster that was used by Jack Harkness in the episode "The Doctor Dances". Moffat suggests that it was left in the TARDIS after "The Parting of the Ways", and taken by River Song in the Doctor's future. The name "squareness gun" was coined by Rose Tyler in the earlier episode.[2]

Production [ edit ]

Writing [ edit ]

"Forest of the Dead" was initially announced under the title "River's Run",[3] before its name was changed relatively late in production.[4] Josh and Ella, Donna's two children in the computer-generated world, were named after Steven Moffat's son and his son's friend.[5]

Casting [ edit ]

For the role of River Song, whom producer Russell T Davies describes as "sort of the Doctor's wife", the production sought to cast Kate Winslet.[6] One of Winslet's first acting roles was in the BBC teen drama Dark Season, written by Davies. The role of River Song eventually went to Alex Kingston, about whom Davies said, "I bloody love her!"[6]

The role of Strackman Lux went to Steve Pemberton, who is best known for his work as a member of The League of Gentlemen. Pemberton's fellow League member Mark Gatiss wrote the Doctor Who episodes "The Unquiet Dead", "The Idiot's Lantern" and "Victory of the Daleks", and appeared in the episodes "The Lazarus Experiment" and "The Wedding of River Song". He also appeared in Blackpool with David Tennant.

Filming [ edit ]

Several scenes from this episode and "Silence in the Library" were filmed at Swansea's Brangwyn Hall. These include the library reception area where the TARDIS arrives, and the staircase where the Doctor and Donna look out over the empty library. The climactic scenes of the episode (in the library core) were filmed in an electrical substation of a disused Alcoa factory in Waunarlwydd, Swansea.[7] Other scenes were filmed at the Old Swansea Central Library.[8]

Scenes set in CAL's databanks were filmed at Dyffryn Gardens, St Nicholas.[9]

The wedding dress Catherine Tate wears in this episode is the same dress she wore in "The Runaway Bride".[7]

Reception [ edit ]

Forest of the Dead was watched by 7.84 million viewers,[10] giving it a 40% audience share; the highest in Series Four and the highest in its timeslot.[11] The episode received an Appreciation Index score of 89 (considered "Excellent"), one of the highest figures the new series had received to date, alongside "The Parting of the Ways", "Doomsday" and the preceding episode "Silence in the Library".[12]

This episode, along with "Silence in the Library", was nominated for a Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form category.[13]

The musicologist Alan Lomax supported this Scottish origin, saying that the song was an American "re-make of British materials."[1]

Many different versions of this song exist, some addressed to females and others addressed to males, as well as other differences:

...like some rosy fair... or ...like a rose so fair... or ... something wondrous fair

or or ...the prettiest face and the neatest hands... or ...the sweetest face and the gentlest hands... or ... the clearest eyes and the strongest hands

or or ... ...still I hope the time will come... or ...some times I wish the day will come... or ... I shall count my life as well begun, when he and I shall be as one.

or or ... ...you and I shall be as one... or ...s/he and I can be as one...

These words are set to two distinct melodies, one of which is traditional and the other was written by the Kentucky folk singer and composer John Jacob Niles. Niles recalled that his father thought the traditional melody was "downright terrible", so he wrote "a new tune, ending it in a nice modal manner." This melody was used in the Folk Songs song cycle by Luciano Berio.[2]

The song has become a part of the traditional repertory of Celtic music artists. The song was collected as "Black is the color" by Cecil Sharp & Maud Karpeles in 1916 from Mrs Lizzie Roberts. It appeared in Sharps English Folksongs From The Southern Appalachians (1932).[3] In the 1960s, Patty Waters sang an extended version for an ESP record which veered towards the avant garde and extremes of vocal improvisation,[4][unreliable source?] standing as a landmark in the use of folk tunes as a starting point to other musical areas.[citation needed]

It’s simple, these lil ones are unaware of the 'Blue Steel', 'Le Tigre’, ‘Ferrari’ or ‘Magnum’ that Derek Zoolander made famous. Toddlers tend to give an most honest, pure and genuine expression to the camera lens. The real difficulty is to capture it, because boy oh boy they are restless, quick and generally extremely hard to catch sitting in one place.

Wholesome Linen brings to you easy camera and photography tips to help you get that perfect photo of your adorable Toddler:



1. Make sure your camera settings are correct for the specific time of day



If you are using a DSLR camera and you are planning to photograph your toddler during the day, make sure your Shutter Speed is 1/125 c or faster. If they or anything in the frame is moving you are going to want to be in between 1/250 to 1/500. Choose a well lit spot, by the window. If you taking photos in the evening or you are planing to shoot in low light, change your ISO setting to MAX and lower your Aperture to Minimum. By doing this you can get magical shots by lit Christmas tree for example with great depth and holiday feeling. Best light is in early morning until 9am find a nice sun spot, you may have to remove your cat, or during magic hour when Sun sets down during the Winter from 4 pm to 5 pm depending on where you live.



2. Get down on Toddler level

When you are photographing toddlers it is better to kneel down or sit on your bum to get to the same eye level. This way they will feel more comfortable and you will have a better angle to capture close ups of your little munchkin.



3. Get help with Toddler from your spouse or any family member

Ask your spouse or any family member who has a good connection with your little one to help you get your toddler's attention and eyes on camera. Make sure your helper will be standing behind you and camera, entertaining toddler dangling toys above the lens to get them to look just above the camera. If they start getting bored try reciting their favorite story or nursery rhyme and generally acting life a goofy kid to get that elusive perfect smile. In these moments, burst shots from your camera is your friend.



4. Don't force your Toddler

Remember that kids get tired of shooting much faster than adults and in case your toddler refuses to photograph when he or she sees the camera put the camera down and take a break and start again when they are in the mood. Another option is to try a long or telescope lens 85 mm or longer. This way you can take a great close up photographs from other side of the room being natural without your toddler getting shy and running away from the camera. The more patient you are, the more likely you will get that perfect photo.



5. Engage your Toddler into play or some kind of activity



                                                                                                                               0279533-44c1581085751556d223d4c2bd60283f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005662 00000000000 014543  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        UPDATE 3: With over 96% of precincts reporting, it looks like Syriza will end up with 149 seat in Parliament, just 2 shy of an absolute majority, although already several of the parties that are entering parliament have vocied their intention to allign with Syriza, so it will hardly be a significant hindrance to Tsipras to conduct whatever anti-Troika policy he wishes.

UPDATE: Greek Government official admits electoral defeat by Syriza

As AP reports,

A senior official in Greece's governing conservatives has conceded defeat to the radical left Syriza party in Sunday's national elections. "We lost," Health Minister Makis Voridis told private Mega TV. "The extent of that result is not yet clear." Voridis, the conservative party's parliamentary spokesman, says the government's austerity policies, implemented to secure vital international bailouts, "make sense" but were cut short before they could bear fruit. An exit poll on state Nerit TV projects Syriza winning by a wide margin.

* * *

The first Greek exit polls are out and here they are:

According to the initial exit polls, in first place, with some 35.5%-39.5% of the vote is Syriza, a huge lead over the second placing New Democracy which has 23-27% of the vote - far more than polls had indicated previously - and a spot which essentially assures Tsipras' party an absolute majority in parliament and the ability to take as hardline an approach as he wishes.

The other parties:

Golden Dawn nationalists: 6.4-8.0%

The new party, To Potami, also with : 6.4-8.0%

Venizelos' socialist Pasok: 4.2%-5.2%

KKE: 4.7%-5.7%

Independent Greeks: 3.5%-4.5%

Knima: 2.2%-3.2%: probably not enough to pass the 3.0% threshold

How the parliament breakdown would look like with these numbers: SYRIZA has a 12.5 percentage point lead over New Democracy and is expected to get between 146 and 158 seats in Parliament, according to the exit polls.

SYRIZA 152 (146-158)

ND 70 ( 65- 75)

Golden Dawn 19.5 ( 17- 22)

POTAMI 19.5 ( 17- 22)

KKE 14.5 ( 13- 16)

PASOK 13.5 ( 12- 15)

ANEL 11.5 ( 10- 13)

KINIMA ( 0- 8)

A second take on what Greek parliament would look like also gives Syriza an almost certain majority:

Kapa Research projection of MPs: SYRIZA 148-154; ND 70-78; GD 16-20; Potami 16-19 #greece #ekloges2015 — Kathimerini English (@ekathimerini) January 25, 2015

A quick observation:

Greek exit polls: Extraordonarily, neo-nazi Golden Dawn could end up with more seats than Pasok (who won 44% of votes in 2009 election) — Mats Persson (@matsJpersson) January 25, 2015

In short: if nothing changes drastically from here, a blowout victory for Syriza is essentially assured, one which gives it an absolute majority.

And that was Anadolu Efes (the Istanbul 76ers) this offseason. Out went Saric with a bundle of solid wings in Jon Diebler, Elijah Johnson and Alex Tyus and in came a young(er) band of NBA castoffs in Tyler Honeycutt, Bryce Cotton, DeShaun Thomas and Co. The cleaner wing rotation this season wasn't a coincidence either - the team is certainly expecting a step-up from Sixers first-round pick Furkan Korkmaz as a rotation 2/3 and secondary ball-handler. And so far, the 19 year-old looks far more prepared to handle a real role than he did a year ago.

Although he saw a DNP-CD in the team's first Euroleague action, Korkmaz has already seen the floor quite a bit in regular season play. In the team's season-opener against Istanbul, he saw 15 minutes and put in ten points, including 1-of-4 from distance. He then started in Efes' road opener against Ankara, playing 22 minutes and pouring in 18 points, three boards and an assist on 7-of-13 shooting from the field, including 4-of-5 from deep, in a 49-point win. Ankara is one of the worst teams in this league, but it's good to see Korkmaz get into a rhythm regardless.

I haven't gotten a chance to watch Korkmaz just yet this season, so I'll hold off on the #takes until next week, but he has his work cut out for him before he makes the jump over to the NBA. He has to add some serious muscle to compete defensively, and some muscle addition could go a long way in adding some burst to a physical profile that otherwise lacks it. And of course, more than anything else, he needs reps, and if the first couple of weeks are any indication, he'll at the very least get those in BSL play. Efes faces off with Olympiacos in Euroleague play today, so it'll be interesting to monitor if he sees the floor at that level of competition just yet. Erick Green and Kostas Papanikolau, among others, would be good tests for him.

Vasilije Micic: After finishing out his season on loan with Crvena zvezda, Sixers 2014 second-round pick Vasilije Micic headed back to Turkey, joining Tofas Bursa in the BSL for this upcoming season. And he's wasted no time making his presence felt against high-end domestic competition.

In the season opener against David Blatt's new-look Darussafaka squad, Micic went for 21 points and four dimes in 30 minutes, including six (!!!) three-pointers out of 10 attempts. Matching up against a talented guard rotation of Scottie Wilbekin, James Anderson and Brad Wanamaker too.

The following week at Galatasaray, he poured in 20 points again, and on four treys, with two steals and a couple of assists.

Micic was brutal last season, getting played out of Bayern and barely cracking 30 percent shooting from the field on loan for the second half on multiple levels of competition. He's shot under 30 percent from long range the last two years with the clubs he's played with, with an AST:TO ratio no higher than 1.5 along the way. He hasn't looked like any semblance of an NBA player. But this is impressive, and to do this to two Euroleague teams makes it just a tad less likely that it's just a mirage.

But, yeah, it's probably just a mirage. We'll see how he follows this up in another matchup with Darussafaka on Saturday, but as if you even need reminding, I'd advise we all keep our Vasilije Micic expectations tempered.

Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope has detected a rare hypervelocity star that was spat out of the centre of our galaxy and is travelling three times as fast as the Sun.

Scientists believe that it was created when three stars travelling together passed too close to the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way around a hundred million years ago.

One of the stars was captured while the other two were flung out of the galaxy and merged to form a super-hot blue star travelling at around 1.6 million miles per hour.

A Nasa graphic showing how the 'blue straggler' was spat out of the centre of our galaxy

Known as HE 0437-5439 it is one of the fastest stars ever detected and is the first to be directly linked with the centre of the galaxy.

'Using Hubble, we can for the first time trace back to where the star came from by measuring the star's direction of motion on the sky. Our measurements point directly to the Milky Way center.' said astronomer Warren Brown of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.

Brown, a member of the Hubble team that observed the star, is the lead author on a paper about the finding published online in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Brown said, 'These exiled stars are rare in the Milky Way's population of 100 billion stars. For every 100 million stars in the galaxy, there lurks one hypervelocity star.'

The stellar outcast already is cruising in the Milky Way's distant outskirts about 200,000 light-years from the galaxy's centre.

Using Hubble to measure the runaway star's direction and determine the Milky Way's core as its starting point, Brown and Gnedin's team calculated how fast the star had to have been ejected to reach its current location.

'Studying these stars could provide more clues about the nature of some of the universe's unseen mass, and it could help astronomers better understand how galaxies form,' said team leader Oleg Gnedin of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

The star's age is another mystery. Based on the speed and position of HE 0437-5439, the star would have to be 100 million years old to have journeyed from the Milky Way's core.

But its mass -nine times that of our sun - and blue colour mean that it should have burned out after only 20 million years far shorter than the transit time it took to get to its current location.

This concept for imparting an escape velocity on stars was first proposed in 1988. The theory predicted the Milky Way's black hole should eject a star about once every 100,000 years.

The triple-star system contained a pair of closely orbiting stars and a third outer member also gravitationally tied to the group. The black hole pulled the outer star away from the tight binary system.                                                                                                                                                   0279474-0f1e6e04bafeba22b2d6fb1c1ab7ec3c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003611 00000000000 015607  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Share.

Seth Green and Matthew Senreich's love of Star Wars is clear to anyone who watches their series Robot Chicken, which has done two half-hour specials devoted completely to Star Wars parodies. Now, Green and Senreich are going to take that love further by teaming with Lucasfilm Animation for an ongoing series set in the Star Wars universe – one that will have a decidedly comic bent.

Said Seth Green, "The Star Wars universe is so dense and rich; it's crazy to think that there aren't normal, mundane everyday problems in a world so well-defined. And it's even crazier to think of what those problems might be, since it's all set in a galaxy far, far away. What do these characters do when they're not overthrowing Empires?"

"We're going to pull back the curtain of some of those behind-the-scenes shenanigans," says Senreich. "It's going to appeal to all ages, the way Star Wars should – but there'll be plenty buried under the surface, as well. As Obi-Wan might say, 'it all depends on your point of view'."

Brendan Hay, a Simpsons writer and former Daily Show producer will be a writer on the project, which is produced by Jennifer Hill (The Backyardigans) and directed by Todd Grimes (Back at the Barnyard).

"There are so many stories taking place in the Star Wars universe, and they don't all have to focus on the fate of the galaxy," said Grimes. "We're looking at Star Wars from a new perspective; this will be a glimpse at how the rest of the galaxy is affected by the events of the Saga. There's a lot of humor to be mined from that."

No network has yet been announced for the series.

Recently, IESB reported that there was a new Star Wars animated series aimed at pre-schoolers in the works, but there has been no confirmation from Lucasfilm on that front as yet.                                                                                                                       0279492-ad21acafacd70c1e79f9a29fbff2b23c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001711 00000000000 015631  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        If you can hear or see no weevils, it may be because the small, leaf-eating beetles with elbow-shaped antennae are hiding out in a caterpillar’s house. The invasive Asiatic oak weevil (Cyrtepistomus castaneus, pictured) finds a home away from home inside leaf sandwiches—called leaf ties—that some native caterpillars bind together for a nest. Researchers had thought that weevils fed on only the best leaves, but then noticed them congregating inside leaf ties. To investigate, they fastened two leaves together with a metal hair clip to make artificial ties in six tree species in Cuivre River State Park in Missouri. After several weeks, tied leaves harbored three-and-a-half times as many weevils as single ones across all six species, researchers report online this month in Ecology. They claim that this is the first report of native species inadvertently helping out an invader by creating a shelter from predators and the elements.

One of those posts dealt with the rampant and repeated demands for evidence regarding the incident that Rebecca had called creepy — as though recounting a story and saying “guys, don’t do that, it’s creepy” was some kind of misandrist clarion call, which must be rebuffed lest it result in fewer pick-up artists getting their dicks wet.

So these trolls, being part of the skeptical community (apparently), used our strengths against us by attacking the claim on its merits, since the claim “I was tipsy in an elevator at 4am and a guy followed me in and asked me to his room” doesn’t meet the high standards of evidence we use in the skeptical community when it comes to extraordinary claims. Never mind that it was a perfectly ordinary claim about someone’s experience with a slightly-offputting person that did not result in any physical harm. Specifically, I characterized this compulsion as hyper-skepticism, along the same lines as 9/11 truthers, birthers, and other conspiracy theorists.

We’re now seeing the exact same tactic being used again in the wake of a conflagration that Jen McCreight accidentally set off when she casually mentioned at the Women In Secularism CFI conference that female speakers occasionally warn one another of potentially creepy male speakers.



Since Stephanie called for real harassment policies to be implemented, and over half a dozen conventions started putting a very good template policy into place in response, real progress has been made on the issue. Progress involving building infrastructure that ameliorates the problem and provides harassment victims with real support. People have come forward with their specific complaints about harassment that had not been reported immediately, supporting the need for these infrastructures — and the hyper-skeptics replied in droves, “but where’s your evidence!?”

In the middle of all this, DJ Grothe, president of JREF, wondered aloud whither all the women were going, and why female TAM registration — while they had made such great inroads at TAM9, after implementing a harassment policy of their own — was way down. He wondered further whether all those women reporting harassment and working to try to get conventions to implement real support structures were, in actuality, driving people away from his vaunted convention.

When the conversation was not going his way, DJ made some very pointed remarks about specific women who’ve worked on the problem of harassment before; including some women who had taken him personally to task for attacking feminists as contra the skeptical movement, and defending some rather indefensible folks (including the Epstein/Krauss flap) in the past. The hyper-skeptics repeated their cries of “where’s the evidence!?”, aiming those cries at the women targeted.

They meant of course to ask where the evidence was that there was even any harassment that needed addressing, naturally. That was, after all, the point that DJ was trying to make — that point became especially obvious when he claimed that the complaints sounded like “locker room talk”, “rumors”, or discussion of “sexual exploits” that women thereafter regretted. But there’s a really good question that is raised when these folks ask that one in this context: where is the evidence that DJ Grothe used to make the leap that the problem this whole time has been those damned uppity feminists scaring everyone away?

Consider that Melody Hensley put together the apparently awesome Women In Secularism conference, and that those of us in the skeptical community who are not independently wealthy have to consider travel, expenses and vacation time. Single parents, predominantly but not always women, often also have to consider parenting issues — who to get to babysit the kids for the conference while they go get their skeptic on. This means there are large financial and personal hurdles to going to every conference if you’re not making money on the public speaking circuit or a member of an organization yourself, which limits the number or frequency of conventions you can attend. That has the knock-on effect that, when a new conference springs up with a high draw value for the demographic you’re looking to improve, you might see your own numbers erode. I am shocked that DJ did not consider this as a possibility before he decided to throw several women bloggers under that bus.

To the point the trolls are making, about where the evidence is that there’s even a harassment problem at all considering DJ’s “exit survey” from TAM showing no such thing, is a pretty good one. At least, if you only consider the data he’s providing, and do not question the data collection methods and the greater societal problem of harassment and underreporting. See, there’s a serious problem with that, which we can demonstrate (with scientific evidence, no less!), showing women simply putting up with harassment because it’s easier. We have some numbers specifically from the secular community, though there may be those same reporting biases at work there too. Regardless, the numbers show a significantly larger proportion of women than men experiencing harassment, and a very large amount of that being very serious and actionable harassment. So why isn’t it being reported?

Well, because we haven’t made this space safe yet, partly. Not “unsafe” as in you’ll almost certainly get assaulted, but “not safe” as in it is no better than background levels of harassment. The victims of harassment are not reporting it mostly for the same reasons that harassment in society as a whole is drastically underreported. And the reasons in just about every case are the same: power imbalance, fear of retaliation, belief that nothing will come of the report, embarassment.

Pteryxx proves that underreporting is a major issue in a comment xe left at Ophelia’s (with a minor correction in-line at hir request):

All righty… I did some research into the problems with using surveys to determine the prevalence of sexual harassment. Much of what I found was paywalled research. It’s not something that can be done with a general survey not designed for the purpose. Basically, surveying sexual harassment is difficult *at all* because of pervasive underreporting. As with sexual assault and rape, only a small percentage of incidents are ever reported, for many reasons: the victims are too embarrassed or ashamed, they assume (often rightly) that nothing will be done to address the problem, or they’ve normalized the harm. Fear of retaliation or escalation, while also major factors, probably don’t have much effect on a truly anonymous survey. This is from page 32 of a 2005, 72-page report on sexual harassment among US college students (it’s big but quite readable): http://www.aauw.org/learn/research/upload/DTLFinal.pdf Given the strong reactions to sexual harassment,

we would expect students to report incidents, yet

most do not. More than one-third (35 percent)

tell no one. Almost half (49 percent) confide in

a friend, but only about 7 percent report the

incident to a college employee. Female students are more likely than male

students to tell someone about sexual harassment,

although they, too, have reservations about

discussing their experiences (see Figure 10).

A common theme among female students is a

feeling of nervousness or discomfort at reporting

something that might not be “a big enough deal.”

One young woman describes an incident that

made her feel “horrible” and “helpless,” but

she didn’t report it because “it didn’t seem to

be that important.” Also, for a victim to report sexual harassment (or sexual assault, or rape), the person has to first admit that what happened to them WAS harassment, assault, or rape. From a 2004 U of Iowa report: http://www.uiowa.edu/csw/reports/sexual-harassment/2004Sexual-Harassment-Survey-012306-ExecSummary.pdf Because research has shown that many people are reluctant or unwilling to label even serious unwelcomed behavior (e.g., physical assault of a sexual nature) as sexual harassment, this survey separated questions about respondents’ experiences with unwelcomed sexual behaviors from the question of whether or not they felt they had experienced sexual harassment. The intent was to capture more accurately the occurrence of behaviors without the stigma of the label. This survey asked about eight types of unwelcomed behavior which may constitute sexual harassment. A majority–52%–of respondents indicated that they had experienced one or more of the eight categories of unwelcomed behavior. Yet, when these responders were asked explicitly about whether they had experienced sexual harassment in the past 10 years at UI, most responders (62%) indicated that they had not been sexually harassed, whereas 24% (805 individuals)) indicated that they considered the unwelcome behavior to be sexual harassment. This represented 26% of female and 19% of male responders. It’s not just that DJ Grothe’s survey fails to capture the incidence of sexual harassment. ANY form of self-reporting will fail to do so, as long as sexual aggression combined with victim-blaming is culturally normal, particularly when internalized so that the victims blame themselves. Sexual harassment and violence can only be addressed in a supportive environment – otherwise, the vast majority of harassed persons will simply remain silent. If a culture exists at DJ Grothe’s organization that is not supportive of victims, as may be indicated by his recent remarks, then that culture could have DIRECTLY contributed to the observed low reporting rate. One instance of a witnessed, publicly reported incident has already been shown to have gone unrecorded within TAM’s harassment reporting system. Thus, the low reporting rate at TAM may be largely a RESULT, not a cause, of DJ’s (publicly articulated) perception that sexual harassment is not a problem under his purview. – *note: I decided (with reservations) to stay with the term “victim” throughout to keep focus on the concept of victim-blaming. Not all recipients of sexual harassment consider themselves victimized by it.

Underreporting is a problem because spaces aren’t safe. Declaring a space safe by fiat won’t work, even if you’ve attempted to enforce the policy really well during certain incidents, and if the data you’ve collected says nobody “felt unwelcome” because you never aggregated in those incidents in the first place — because you’re going to have a major problem with that data when someone comes forward to contradict it. Especially if you thereafter try to gaslight that person and convince them that there was never any such event. The data collection methodology was simply insufficient here, and incidents apparently happened and were dealt with in realtime that were never documented thereafter and thus never showed up in DJ’s numbers.

We have a manifold problem with harassment in the skeptical community, one that won’t be solved by ignoring the fact that they’re plugging their ears every time someone actually proffers evidence to meet the trolls’ demands. The only path forward, as far as I can see, is to steamroll the trolls by moving forward with implementing strong anti-harassment policies at conventions, leaving these trolls to deal with the consequences despite their cries that we’re implementing some sort of Taliban-like puritanism (heh), and doing so in such a way that everyone’s well aware that there will be consequences for violating those policies, and that victims will be protected.

THAT is how you make a space safe. Certainly not by answering every disingenuous call for evidence, despite that being our natural compulsion as a community — we’re skeptics after all — and especially not when you can legitimately say “Objection! Asked and answered!” Preferably with a link back to this post, if you could be so kind.

Of course, you could also take the tactic favoured by Stephanie Zvan — ask the trolls exactly what sort of evidence it would take to convince them that the person they’re trolling experienced what they say they experienced. When they inevitably clam up, THEN point them here.

A coyote sneaks a drink from a mossy pool. The black and white photos that flash across Professor Mark Jordan’s computer screen look like they could have been shot out on the Olympic Peninsula or maybe at a remote spot in the Cascades — until a curious house cat sneaks out of the underbrush.

These images, along with the 50,000 other stills that Jordan collected last summer, all came from game cameras stationed in public parks around Seattle. Since 2013, Jordan and his Seattle University biology students have been on the lookout for urban predators — coyotes, opossums and raccoons.

“The big-picture question I’m interested in is how does urbanization affect wild mammals, in particular predatory mammals that are higher up on the food chain?” says Jordan.

It’s a drizzly fall day when Jordan and Diana Jacobsmeyer, a senior at Seattle University, drive south to collect the last camera traps of the field season. Jordan’s Subaru idles in stop-and-go traffic as we roll past looming construction cranes and busy pho restaurants.

“That’s one big difference compared to working in the national forest — the traffic” Jordan says. Then he corrects himself: “Except during hunting season, when the traffic in the national forest is just as bad.”

Prior to moving to Seattle, Jordan’s Ph.D. research involved tracking down fishers, two-foot-long weasels, in California’s remote Southern Sierra Nevada range. He spent time living in a Forest Service cabin, searching for game trails where unsuspecting wildlife might amble through.

Although urban Puget Sound feels like a completely different world from backcountry California, Jordan is quick to point out the similarities in the work.

“The general rules of ecology still apply in an urban area, as they would in a wilderness area,” he says. The research still comes down to understanding a complex web of interactions between predator and prey, humans and wildlife, species and environment.



Today, we’re traipsing through a small, green space sandwiched between a suburban neighborhood and an industrial park. The Duwamish River flows lazily by. Discarded beer cans and a small shack line the bank. Just around the next bend is the Seattle Sounders’ practice field and a little farther on is the polluted Lower Duwamish Superfund site.

Every spring, Jordan’s research team looks for spots across South Seattle just like this one — islands of tree cover surrounded by bustling development. Sometimes the researchers will deploy a baited box lined with bristles used for gathering hair samples.

There’s no bait box at the Duwamish site today, but we do stop to collect the motion-activated field camera the team dropped off three weeks ago. The metal box is bike-locked to the base of a tree, mounted at shoe level and pointed in the direction of a small game trail. If set up properly, the camera will have documented who, or what, has been scurrying around Seattle’s parks.

Back in Jordan’s office, he pops a camera memory card into his computer and begins scrolling. People and pets — the boots of a passing hiker, a dog straining at its leash — are mixed with shots of wandering wildlife — a pair of soaking-wet raccoons, a raccoon missing its tail, another raccoon scurrying from tree to tree.

“We’ve gotten at least one photograph of a raccoon in every single park that we’ve sampled,” Jordan says.

In fact, the data collected from Jordan’s field sites over the past three years seems to point in a consistent direction: “As you increase urbanization, you actually get an increase in detections of raccoons.”

That may seem surprising to us, but Jordan says it makes perfect sense:

“We create conditions for raccoons that tend to make them quite happy.”

As human presence increases, along with roads, buildings, and domestic pets, Jordan speculates that competition drops off from larger predators like mountain lions. Raccoons move in to take advantage of our garbage as an easy food source.

To better understand how these critters use the urban environment, we leave Jordan’s office and head up the hill to a biology lab just off campus. Up a few flights of stairs, tucked behind rows packed with lab equipment, Jordan pulls the handle of a massive industrial freezer. The door swings open and a cloud of frost reveals a stack of small cardboard boxes.

“My students right now are working on a project where they’re coming up with a genetic way to identify the species that left a hair sample,” Jordan explains.

Each sample is stored in its own small vial, categorized by location, and kept at -86 degrees celsius. Ultimately, the researchers are hoping to understand how different species interact with the city. Do raccoons, opossums, and coyotes have different movement patterns between these islands of green space?

For Jordan, the project is a reminder that nature doesn’t stop at the edge of the city, and in fact, that some wild creatures thrive in our shadow. “Within a square kilometer of Seattle,” he says, “you might actually find more mammalian carnivores than you would in the same square kilometer out in the forest.”

She knows it. As the 33-year-old homemaker puts it, she's filled with an overwhelming sense of "spiritual wholeness" and "personal well-being" every time she looks at her 5-year-old son Dakota.

"Dakota makes me feel so complete," said Glauber, gazing with deep affection and devotion at her grubby, disheveled son, who was searching for a wall on which to wipe a mass of mucus he had rooted from his nose. "Even after I got married, I still sensed that something was missing from my life. But the day Dakota was born, that void was filled."

"I knew I always wanted to have a child, but I honestly didn't realize just how magical motherhood would be," said Glauber, enduring repeated kicks to the shins from a cookie-demanding Dakota. "Of course, you can't really know what it's like until you go through it. And I thank God daily that I did."

After waddling into the kitchen and devouring two individually wrapped Little Debbie Zebra Cakes, Dakota sat down in the living room among a pile of toys he had strewn across the floor. Picking up a large dump truck, he dropped it on a smaller toy helicopter, causing it to shatter. He then forced open the remote control to an off-road stunt racer, tore out its battery coils, and gummed up its wiring with sticky cookie crumbs and a large gob of drool from his shirt sleeve.

"You know, it's supposedly the parent's job to teach the child," Glauber said. "But I'm the one who's always learning new things from Dakota. Things like grace, understanding and the wonder of childhood. And most of all, he teaches me the bliss of pure, unconditional love."

Dakota has taught his mother a great many other things, as well, including how to whine like a hyena, refuse to go to bed, scribble doodles on the wall, yank the cat's tail and watch endless hours of TV in a semi-catatonic state, rousing himself only, and to near-hysteria, when someone tries to change the channel.

"Dakota is the summit of all my hopes and dreams, and if I fail him, I fail myself—and the world," Glauber said. "And I'm determined not to let that happen."

"He truly is a miracle," continued Glauber, removing a collector's plate from the living-room curio cabinet and placing it on the dining-room table. Ornately decorated with rosy-cheeked cherubim, the plate bears the gold-leaf inscription, "As God Makes Each Snowflake Different, So He Does With Every Precious Child."

"I got this plate at the mall the other day, and for me, it really sums it all up," Glauber said. "Sometimes my husband teases me about indulging Dakota too much, and maybe I do. But I'm convinced that God gives us children to help us understand just how wonderful and rich life is."

As his mother finished speaking, Dakota careened his Big Wheel into the dining-room table, causing the collector plate to fall to the floor and shatter. He then darted away as fast as his considerable girth and lack of coordination would allow.

Dakota's father Donald, a 39-year-old systems analyst for Digitek Industries in nearby Manalapan, shared his own feelings for his only child.

"Frankly, if it was up to me, I'd dope up the kid so full of Ritalin, he could be used as a paperweight," said Glauber, speaking from a local tavern. "But you know how the wife is: 'He's a little angel sent from heaven,' and all that crap. Whatever. She can deal with him. It's no mistake I've been working all this overtime lately."

(ANTIMEDIA) After Saudi Arabia executed prominent Shi’ite cleric, Sheikh Nimr Baqr al-Nimr, and 46 other people, protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran on Saturday, ransacking and setting fire to the building and its contents. In a surprise response the following day, Saudi Arabia announced it would sever diplomatic ties with Iran — giving Iranian diplomats 48 hours to evacuate, while recalling its own diplomats back from Iran.

“This Saudi-Iranian sudden and acute crisis is a very worrisome development, and we must at all costs avoid that it produces a chain of violent consequences in the region,” warned United Nations mediator, Staffan de Mistura, in an email to the New York Times.

“This is a very disturbing escalation,” said Michael Stephens, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute research center in London, according to the Times. “It has enormous consequences for the people of the region, and the tensions between the two sides are going to mean that instability across the region is going to continue.”

On Monday, three Sunni-led nations — Bahrain, Sudan, and the United Arab Emirates joined the Saudis in breaking or greatly reducing diplomatic relations with Iran.

Despite prior international calls to grant the outspoken cleric clemency — and sharp warnings from Iran of dire consequences should the execution be carried out — the al-Saud monarchy pushed ahead with its message via mass execution, ironically intended to quash possible violence against the State. As promised, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei issued a sharp rebuke condemning the execution of al-Nimr, published on his official website:

“Doubtlessly, this innocent martyr’s blood, which was spilled unjustly, will quickly show its effect and the divine vengeance will befall the Saudi politicians.

“This innocent scholar had neither incited people to take up arms nor had he hatched any covert plot, and the only activity he did was open criticism [of the Saudi regime] […]

“The Almighty God shall not ignore the innocents’ blood and the unjustly spilled blood will backfire on the politicians and the executives of this regime very quickly.”

In a press conference on Sunday, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir stressed that Riyadh would not allow Tehran to put the kingdom’s security in peril. He also cautioned the monarchy would reject all criticism of the Saudi justice system.

Al-Jubeir called Tehran “a regional menace for its smuggling of arms and explosives and its previous harboring of al-Qaeda militants” and “the aggressive statements of the Iranian regime encouraged the attacks on Saudi [embassies], adding that Iran has a history of supporting terrorism, citing its support to the bloody regime of Bashar al-Assad.” Responding to a journalist’s question, “Al-Jubeir said the Iranian government is involved in the attacks on the Saudi embassy, adding that Iranian security were present at the scene, yet they never attempted to drive out the protesters.” He called on the international community to “review Iranian intransigence,” and portentously added, “all options are open for us to deter Iran.”

It’s difficult to discredit comparisons of the Sunni al-Saud monarchy to the brutal Islamic State terrorists it and the West claim to be at war with; in fact, the only element missing in the likeness was videotaped footage of the nearly 160 known beheadings it carried out last year. Not to mention, a mass execution of this scale hadn’t been exacted by the kingdom since 1980, when 63 insurgents who had seized the Grand Mosque in 1979 were publicly beheaded. Though Riyadh normally executes those convicted in common areas for all to see, Saturday’s killings were hidden from the public. That became a further point of contention for demonstrators, who suspected such secrecy indicated political rather than legal motivation — especially since al-Nimr’s popularity had much to do with empowering the Shi’ite minority, which included piercing criticism of the House of Saud.

In the Independent, Robert Fisk explained the rage sparked by the cleric’s politicized execution:

“For Sheikh Nimr was not just any old divine. He spent years as a scholar in Tehran and Syria, and was a revered Shia [sic] leader of Friday prayers in the Saudi Eastern Province, and a man who stayed clear of political parties but demanded free elections, and was regularly detained and tortured — by his own account — for opposing the Sunni Wahabi Saudi government. Sheikh Nimr said that words were more powerful than violence. The authorities’ whimsical suggestion that there was nothing sectarian about this most recent bloodbath — on the grounds that they beheaded Sunnis as well as Shias — was classic ISIS rhetoric.”

Grouping Sheikh al-Nimr and three Shi’ite political activists together with 43 Sunnis accused of acting in concert with al-Qaeda in the region belies the Saudis’ true intentions to deliberately provoke archenemy Iran and its Sunni allies.

Sheikh Nimr Baqr al-Nimr’s execution means his brother, Mohammed al-Nimr, must now examine every move by the kingdom like a hawk. Mohammed’s son, Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr, has been awaiting crucifixion in a Saudi prison for over four years, after a conviction stemming from his participation in Arab Spring protests. After the sudden beheading of his brother, Mohammed is fraught with worry over his son’s looming draconian death sentence, not knowing “from one moment to the next” when the Saudis might choose to carry out their punishment.

Ayatollah Khamenei’s statement carried an unmistakable message for supporters of the House of Saud, as well. According to the Office of the Supreme Leader,

“Strongly criticizing the silence of the self-proclaimed advocates of freedom, democracy, and human rights, and their support for the Saudi regime, who spills the blood of the innocent only for criticism and protest, Ayatollah Khamenei said: ‘The Muslim world and the entire world must feel responsible towards this issue.’”

On Sunday, State Department spokesperson Elizabeth Trudeau told the media that though the U.S. supports the right to peacefully protest, “we condemn in the strongest terms any attacks on diplomatic properties.” Trudeau cautioned both Saudi Arabia and Iran against “any actions that could further heighten tensions.”

Considering the Saudis’ abrupt end to further diplomacy with Iran, that impuissant warning obviously fell on deaf ears.

Check. Down a man? Check. Coming home with three points? Check.

Sporting Kansas City's club-record away winning streak is now at five matches after Saturday night's 2-1 comeback victory over Toronto FC – and in three of those matches, including this one, Sporting have finished down a man.

“We're actually going to start the next game down a man,” Manager Peter Vermes joked in a conference call after the win, which extended Sporting's unbeaten streak to seven matches and lifted them four points clear of second-place D.C. United in the Eastern Conference standings. “We're just going to play a 4-4-1. That's what we're going to do, going forward.”

The situation looked anything but humorous in the 75th minute, though, when the score was tied at 1 and Matt Besler was sent off – for the first time in his career – after getting his second yellow for a foul on TFC speedster Dominic Oduro. But Sporting regrouped, slotted defensive midfielder Lawrence Olum back into central defense, and got several clutch saves from Andy Gruenebaum down the stretch to keep the Reds from capitalizing on the man advantage.

“It's the mentality,” Vermes said. “You understand what you have to do. There's things that you work on in training. Not only do the guys understand it tactically, but they also have the right mentality. They know how to fight and grind out the points at the end, but more importantly to pick and choose their opportunities and their chances.”

That's another part of Sporting's mentality: not being satisfied with splitting points, even when reduced to 10 men. So they kept looking for ways to find a winner, and second-half sub Jacob Peterson delivered it in the 80th minute when he buried a backheel assist from Dom Dwyer through a crowd of defenders.

“These are huge, huge points on the road,” Vermes said, “especially given the fact that Toronto has games in hand. We've always said in the past, when we've been in that position, that those games don't mean anything unless you get the points. So these were huge, huge points for us tonight in a game like this – with the kind of firepower they brought in this year, the kind of investments they made, it's huge on our part.”

Sporting will have to be resilient and resourceful again on Friday, when they host the Philadelphia Union. Besler will be serving a one-match suspension, and left back Seth Sinovic is questionable after leaving with a right groin strain in the 55th minute on Saturday.

Then again, that's nothing new for a club that has been dealing with injuries and international absences – especially in the back line – all year long.

“I've never been a part of a team like that, as a player or as a coach,” Vermes said. “So it's good to see. It really is. The mentality of this group is galvanized.”

His personal opposition to abortion generated significant scrutiny back in 2008 when Barack Obama, an abortion rights supporter, included the then-Virginia governor on his shortlist of running mates. Kaine’s hometown newspaper in Richmond flagged the potentially awkward partnership right away, pointing out the philosophical and policy differences in a side-by-side graphic widely republished by media outlets across the country.

Story Continued Below

Eight years later, Kaine is again a front-runner in the Democratic veepstakes, and again his views on reproductive rights — an issue central to the Democratic base — are under a microscope in the event Hillary Clinton selects him as her No. 2.

Since joining the Senate in 2012, Kaine has tried to cultivate an image as an abortion-rights champion. He’s pleased reproductive rights’ groups with a perfect voting record. He’s railed against GOP attempts to defund Planned Parenthood. And he’s celebrated in their legal victories, including last week’s Supreme Court ruling tossing out a Texas law that tried limiting a woman’s access to abortion clinics.

But he hasn’t always advanced policies directly in line with those of abortion rights advocacy groups. He pledged in his 2005 gubernatorial campaign to reduce the number of terminated pregnancies in the state by promoting adoption and abstinence-focused education. That cycle, the state NARAL chapter ripped Kaine’s GOP opponent, Jerry Kilgore, as “an extremely anti-choice candidate” but still withheld its endorsement of Kaine because he “embraces many of the restrictions on a woman’s right to choose.”

In a 2007 NARAL scorecard, Kaine was described as a “mixed-choice” governor and his state got an F grade thanks in part to a number of laws and other policies restricting access to abortions. Two years later, Kaine upset both local and national reproductive rights groups by signing a law that authorized the sale of customized “Choose Life” license plates. Kaine argued he was supporting free speech, but his critics complained that the law would fund pro-life organizations and didn’t square with another very important hat that he was wearing at the time: Obama’s personally picked head of the Democratic National Committee.

Kaine brings many other attributes as a running mate, including a widely respected reputation for bipartisanship, after serving just under four years in the Senate, and his own proven political chops winning three straight statewide races in the critical battleground of Virginia. But the hot button issue of abortion, where he has a much more nuanced stance than many of his fellow Democrats, is the baggage he carries.

“People use labels all the time,” Kaine explained in a recent interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” an exchange emblematic of the challenge he faces in talking about a politically volatile topic where his religion conflicts with his policy stance. “I’m kind of a traditional Catholic. Personally, I’m opposed to abortion, and personally, I’m opposed to the death penalty.”

Major abortion rights groups and some of their allies on Capitol Hill are tip-toeing around the prospect of a Clinton-Kaine ticket.

Tarina Keene, president of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia, declined to comment specifically on Kaine’s stance on abortion. Instead, she issued a statement focused on her group’s reasons for endorsing Clinton.

“She is the reproductive freedom champion this country needs. She has a long and unequivocal record of standing up for women’s health and rights. We hope she selects a vice presidential candidate who will continue her fight for reproductive freedom," Keene said, refusing to respond to follow-up questions about Kaine.

Asked whether she had concerns about Kaine’s stance as a Catholic who personally opposes abortion but supports abortion rights policies, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein replied, “It’s a big issue in our party. Others other than myself would have to say that, particularly whoever the presidential candidate is.”

If nothing else, Kaine is well-practiced in abortion politics. In past races, Virginia Republicans have thrown the kitchen sink at him: The 2005 governor’s race, for example, saw GOP ads designed to alarm rural conservatives by claiming Kaine backed “abortion on demand.” And in a tactic widely seen as designed to drive down turnout among a key Democratic constituency, mysterious messages landed in the mailboxes of suburban women with partial quotes from Kaine discussing how he supported some limits on abortions.

But Kaine has also used his GOP opponents’ staunch conservative views on abortion as a handy foil. In 2005, he swung at Kilgore as someone who “believes that you can’t be anti-abortion unless you want to make abortion a crime.” In his 2012 Senate race, Kaine blasted George Allen for his support of a bill that would define life as starting at conception.

“Why would you claim to be a small government guy and propose such a dramatic reach into people’s lives and personal decisions?” Kaine asked Allen during one of their debates.

Since his 2012 election to the Senate, Kaine has tried to burnish his reputation as a supporter of abortion rights. He’s notched a 100 percent voting score from NARAL three years in a row and joined other Democrats in demanding Obamacare include greater access to contraception. He has co-sponsored a bill that would prohibit states from placing restrictions on abortion.

Among his Senate colleagues, Kaine’s personal views on abortion are seen as a nonfactor.

“We’ve got [abortion] issues in Senate Foreign Relations, and he’s never raised them,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.).

“He’s pretty clear on why he believes what he believes and why he’s done what he’s done,” said North Dakota Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a close friend. “He’s able to readily explain his positions and that means they’ve been well thought-out and not just knee-jerk, ‘This is what I need to say today.’ He’s very principled.”

Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins, a Roman Catholic who supports abortion rights, told POLITICO that she’s “sympathetic” to Kaine’s predicament. “It’s possible to feel strongly on a personal level about the decisions one would make in one’s own life while embracing the notion that a public policy position may not be in accord with decisions that you’d make,” she said.

Should Kaine get the VP nod, he won’t be entering uncharted territory either when called on to defend the views of a presidential candidate whose abortion stance goes beyond his. All he has to do is look back at his experience in the fall of 2008 as an Obama surrogate. Among his duties that year: speaking to conservative college students at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, where he patiently explained Obama was open to limiting abortions through health care, education and abstinence but, if elected to the White House, he wouldn’t overturn Roe v.

It's always a thrill, every bit as fizzy as the contents of the chilled coupes we've just been upsold. But it's not all bonhomie and bubbles: there are things that buzzkill as effectively as a sign that says "prop: Gregg Wallace". Here are my worst culprits, the grit in the mussel of restaurant-going.

Tipping and double tipping

The bill has had its 12.5% duly levied, but the card machine starts hectoring you for more cash like a crusty with a dog on a string. There is a school of thought that says you should bung a tenner on top of service if you've been properly schmoozed, but with a meal for two in London routinely costing well over a ton, I fret that if I do they'll think I haven't spotted the charge and undertipped.

No matter how often I eat out, tipping remains a minefield. I like it when service isn't included: I sing hallelujah and tip properly. Alas, there are way too many who don't: when I worked in restaurants, people would sometimes furtively cache a 50p coin under their saucers. My tactic was to run after them bellowing: "Excuse me, sir, you've left your bus fare on the table." These days I pay the service charge, hope and pray it gets to the staff and scuttle off into the night, suffused with some vague sense of guilt and shame.

No reservations

Yes, I know all about the financial imperatives behind this, the necessity for businesses to keep the tills ringing in the face of recession. And I'm aware that for some there's nothing sexier than a long, hot, hard queueing session. But it's not for me: the idea that I might not end up with a table at my chosen restaurant fills me with a nameless, black panic. I've been known to sidle into the likes of Spuntino or Pitt Cue Co at unpopular hours, noon or 10.30 at night, but this is evidence of solitary vice rather than sociable interaction. Stop muttering "get a life" at the back there, and hashtagging #firstworldproblems. This is my life.

Waiters who act like your best pal

"Hey guys, how you doin'?" beams our new best pal, as though he were Joey from the Lower East Side rather than Jeremy from Swindon. He hunkers, comfy-like. There is no evidence of an order pad or new techno thingie on which to commit our order. All of which makes me want to hurtle, screaming, straight to the nearest chippie.

Nobody admires front-of-house practitioners more than I do, but when I'm with my actual friends, I don't need a new, temporary one for the evening. I do not want to be called "laydeez" or be told that the pudding course is "what you've been waiting for". I really do not want to be led to the actual Ladies and have the door held open for me with a knowing grin. Once, in Babylon, Kensington (now owned by Richard Branson), the waiter ushered me into the Gents to show me a kind of peephole into the Ladies. While I'm assured it's no longer there, there is such a thing as being overserved.

Wineglass-filling fascism

There are restaurants where they deliberately leave your wine at a remove from the table so you have no control over your booze intake. Just typing that sends a chill through my marrow: an empty glass during dinner dismays almost as much as begging to have it filled. But worse is one that's relentlessly topped up, a waiter or sommelier permanently at your elbow, destroying anecdotes and galumphing over confidences. To your horror, you discover that the bottle is magically empty and you've only just finished your starters. You order another bottle, trying not to think about the already stratospheric bill. Top relaxing evening guaranteed.

Restaurant websites

These are almost universally awful: clubby music, "clever" flash animation ("please wait while we load" … Next!), the chef's "philosophy", stock photography of random food and a lot of waffling about seasonal and local gleaned from watching Gordon's Kitchen Nightmares. Even worse are those designed for Continental Big Names whose idea of fun is making you chase the cursor around a tableau of dancing hams. All I is want is the menu with prices, maybe some nice photos of the interior, opening hours and contact details. How hard can it be? Almost impossible, apparently.

A nice chat with the chef

When I see the chef looming over to my table, I do not think, "Goody – here's a chap who will love to hear my constructive overview of his cooking," and settle in for a nice tête-à-tête. Unless you're prepared to toe the party line of everything's-bloody-marvellous-you're-a-genius-how-do-you-do-it?, chefs are not interested in your feedback. Try telling them that the duck was overcooked, the chips tasted frozen and the asparagus wasn't local. Go on, I dare you.

'High concept'

An email arrives announcing a new "free-range chicken and egg" restaurant. Menu items include the Bangkok scotch egg made with minced thigh meat and Thai herbs. There's a risotto scotch egg too. I'm not making this up. I long to try these dishes almost as much as I long to swallow my own tongue.

Here are words to strike fear into any food-obsessed heart: "Prezzo opens chicken, burgers and rib concept, Cleaver." That is like telling hardcore musos that the new act is a Bieber-Swift mashup with topnotes of Perry. Or how about Tanner & Co in Bermondsey, which imagines we'd like to eat our dinner in an environment designed to reference school gymnasiums? School gyms only make me think of sweat and despair, not all of it mine.

These are "concept" restaurants, only ever the work of gym-conditioned Justin and almost-anorexic Amanda in the "ideas room" of a catering conglomerate; Apprentice candidates who have somehow escaped into the real world. People who love food and enjoy restaurants don't open "concepts". Nor should we eat in them.

Tasting menus of more than 12 courses

I have never finished one of these things sober. By course nine or so, it's all gone blurry. Because, believe me, you need that Elysium muscat to help ram down the artichoke and foraged elderberry caramelised earth. These menus are all about the chef. For the diner, they're not about pleasure, they're about macho endurance – yes, even for the gals. It's wallet-flexing, every bit as subtle as driving up in a liveried Ferrari wearing head-to-toe Burberry check. Multiple-course aficionados consider themselves way superior to someone stuffing themselves with 97 hotdogs. But by the time you're nibbling course 11, even if it is eel-skin crackers with cherry-smoked backfat, it still amounts to eating as a competitive sport.

'That table is booked'

This is my very favourite. So I've studied the hotshot new openings and booked at the first portentous "booking lines now open" tweet, pecking at my phone like a demented budgie. And still I'm led to the worst table in the house, the one facing into a corner or squashed next to the lavs. As I point tentatively to an empty table in a part of the restaurant that doesn't scream "Hahaha Siberia you loser", the reply comes: "I'm sorry, madam, that table is booked."

It makes me shrieky. How is it booked, how? Who are these people so clued-up that they not only book before anyone even knows it's open, they can specify an actual table?

Of course, the truth isn't "that table is booked", but "we're keeping it for someone better designed to exemplify the brand values of our new white-hot establishment, someone with tattoos, a beard and an artisan salami company. Or some hedge-funders.'"

77%* of restaurants outside major cities

The menu riddled with "jus" and "medley" and "symphony of"; the crescent moon side dishes of mangetout and baby corn; the salad bristling with raw green pepper; those high-backed leather dining chairs you find in the back pages of Restaurant magazine; the staff who have no idea what they're serving. Yep, we're in the provinces. And before you rage and froth and call me all kinds of obnoxious scenester consumerist chimpanzee, I too live in Not London, where I routinely put up with crooked-pinkie culinary pretentions – tomatoes carved into roses, "fennel and gnocchi salad" (truly), crabmeat packed into a lovely plastic crabshell, or, if the chef has ambitions, a dome of smoke over something that once tasted of fish – because there is little alternative. And that's before I start to rant about "food service" companies that knock up that lovely boeuf bourguignon in faceless industrial estate kitchens. No, I don't mean you, you 23%* who are brilliant, who bake all your own bread and pay your staff properly. But if you're looking for me, I'll be on the train to the Smoke.

'The table is yours for a two-hour timeslot'

Aka table-turning. No, ta. Ta-ta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0279528-18a5485cd3b59a6b9178b8a0843a3130.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003550 00000000000 014704  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., suspects Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have lied about his communications with Russian officials under oath when testifying during the Senate confirmation process.

"I think that he did not answer truthfully under oath," Franken said during an interview on MSNBC on Friday.

He was responding to the question of whether Sessions is fit to run the Justice Department after the latest allegations that there may be a third undisclosed meeting last year between Sessions, then a senator, and Russian ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak. Former FBI Director Comey reportedly told senators about that meeting Thursday during the closed-session of his testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Sessions had gotten into trouble in March when it was reported that he had two meetings with Kislyak during the campaign, which contradicted statements in his January confirmation hearing. He later recused himself from any investigations involving Russia.

Pressed by host Chuck Todd about whether Sessions should be removed from office, Franken explained that the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley, doesn't feel inclined to bring Sessions back in for testimony.

He also mentioned his and fellow Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy's' "private letter" to then-FBI Director Comey asking for an investigation into the "fact Sessions had met other times with Russians," including the third possible meeting on April 26, 2016, at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.

"Hopefully" an investigation will get to the bottom of that, said Franken.

Franken also noted that while Sessions may not have to testify again about his Russia contacts before the Judiciary panel, he may get some next week when he appears before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science. Leahy is the senior Democrat on the full appropriations panel.                                                                                                                                                        0279547-e67dce6c8af2975cead5859dc2a4a981.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003505 00000000000 015375  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Rob Carr/Getty Images

Brandon Jennings only suited up for 10 minutes in the Washington Wizards' 114-106 loss to the Toronto Raptors on Friday, but he's already feeling at home in the nation's capital.

Speaking to reporters after his debut with the team, Jennings explained that, while he's still operating as a backup point guard, the Wizards have represented a welcome change of pace after he spent the first four months of the season with the New York Knicks.

"I'm in the same position I was in New York, but just in a better system for me personally and with a team that actually plays together," he said, per CSNMidAtlantic.com's Chase Hughes.

And while Jennings went scoreless (0-of-3 shooting) with two assists and a turnover in defeat, he received words of encouragement from shooting guard Bradley Beal following the low-key debut.

"It is always tough coming into a new situation," Beal said, per Hughes. "You do not want to come up here and look like you are jacking the ball, but we know him as a scorer, we know him as a facilitator, and that is what we need him to do. We are confident in him. It is only one game."

Looking ahead, Jennings will have a chance to flash his electric scoring prowess Sunday when the Wizards clash with the Orlando Magic.

However, the Wizards should temper expectations just a bit since Jennings needs to get acclimated to a new scheme and has never been particularly efficient.

Although Washington is in desperate need of scoring reinforcements—its bench ranks 29th in scoring at 23.5 points per game, per NBA.com—Jennings is a career 38.9 percent shooter from the field and 34.9 percent percent shooter from beyond the arc.

There will assuredly be speed bumps along the way given Jennings' streaky past, but he could help swing a playoff game or two in Washington's favor if he heats up at the right time.                                                                                                                                                                                           0279443-b5c056dc91a8e7d07bcbb52aa6613329.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000057005 00000000000 015174  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The knowledge argument (also known as Mary's room or Mary the super-scientist) is a philosophical thought experiment proposed by Frank Jackson in his article "Epiphenomenal Qualia" (1982) and extended in "What Mary Didn't Know" (1986). The experiment is intended to argue against physicalism—the view that the universe, including all that is mental, is entirely physical. The debate that emerged following its publication became the subject of an edited volume—There's Something About Mary (2004)—which includes replies from such philosophers as Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, and Paul Churchland.

Background [ edit ]

Mary's Room is a thought experiment that attempts to establish that there are non-physical properties and attainable knowledge that can be discovered only through conscious experience. It attempts to refute the theory that all knowledge is physical knowledge. C. D. Broad, Herbert Feigl, and Thomas Nagel, over a fifty-year span, presented insight to the subject, which led to Jackson's proposed thought experiment. Broad makes the following remarks, describing a thought experiment where an archangel has unlimited mathematical competences:

He would know exactly what the microscopic structure of ammonia must be; but he would be totally unable to predict that a substance with this structure must smell as ammonia does when it gets into the human nose. The utmost that he could predict on this subject would be that certain changes would take place in the mucous membrane, the olfactory nerves and so on. But he could not possibly know that these changes would be accompanied by the appearance of a smell in general or of the peculiar smell of ammonia in particular, unless someone told him so or he had smelled it for himself.[1]

Roughly thirty years later, Feigl expresses a similar notion. He concerns himself with a Martian, studying human behavior, but lacking human sentiments. Feigl says:

...the Martian would be lacking completely in the sort of imagery and empathy which depends on familiarity (direct acquaintance) with the kinds of qualia to be imaged or empathized.[2]

Nagel takes a slightly different approach. In an effort to make his argument more adaptable and relatable, he takes the stand of humans attempting to understand the sonar capabilities of bats. Even with the entire physical database at one's fingertips, humans would not be able to fully perceive or understand a bat's sonar system, namely what it is like to perceive something with a bat's sonar.[3]

Thought experiment [ edit ]

The thought experiment was originally proposed by Frank Jackson as follows:

Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like "red", "blue", and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence "The sky is blue". ... What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor? Will she learn anything or not?[4]

In other words, Jackson's Mary is a scientist who knows everything there is to know about the science of color, but has never experienced color. The question that Jackson raises is: once she experiences color, does she learn anything new? Jackson claims that she does.

There is disagreement about how to summarize the premises and conclusion of the argument Jackson makes in this thought experiment. Paul Churchland did so as follows:

Mary knows everything there is to know about brain states and their properties. It is not the case that Mary knows everything there is to know about sensations and their properties. Therefore, sensations and their properties are not the same (≠) as the brain states and their properties.[5]

However, Jackson objects that Churchland's formulation is not his intended argument. He especially objects to the first premise of Churchland's formulation: "The whole thrust of the knowledge argument is that Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about brain states and their properties, because she does not know about certain qualia associated with them. What is complete, according to the argument, is her knowledge of matters physical." He suggests his preferred interpretation:

Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to know about other people. Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about other people (because she learns something about them on her release). Therefore, there are truths about other people (and herself) which escape the physicalist story.[6]

Most authors who discuss the knowledge argument cite the case of Mary, but Frank Jackson used a further example in his seminal article: the case of a person, Fred, who sees a color unknown to normal human perceivers.

Implications [ edit ]

Whether Mary learns something new upon experiencing color has two major implications: the existence of qualia and the knowledge argument against physicalism.

Qualia [ edit ]

First, if Mary does learn something new, it shows that qualia (the subjective, qualitative properties of experiences, conceived as wholly independent of behavior and disposition) exist. If Mary gains something after she leaves the room—if she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before—then that knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the qualia of seeing red. Therefore, it must be conceded that qualia are real properties, since there is a difference between a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.

Refutation of physicalism [ edit ]

Jackson argues that if Mary does learn something new upon experiencing color, then physicalism is false. Specifically, the knowledge argument is an attack on the physicalist claim about the completeness of physical explanations of mental states. Mary may know everything about the science of color perception, but can she know what the experience of red is like if she has never seen red? Jackson contends that, yes, she has learned something new, via experience, and hence, physicalism is false. Jackson states:

It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.[4]

Epiphenomenalism [ edit ]

Jackson believed in the explanatory completeness of physiology, that all behaviour is caused by physical forces of some kind. And the thought experiment seems to prove the existence of qualia, a non-physical part of the mind. Jackson argued that if both of these theses are true, then epiphenomenalism is true—the view that mental states are caused by physical states, but have no causal effects on the physical world.

Explanatory completeness

of physiology + qualia

(Mary's room) = epiphenomenalism

Thus, at the conception of the thought experiment, Jackson was an epiphenomenalist.

Responses [ edit ]

Objections have been raised that have required the argument to be refined. Doubters cite various holes in the thought experiment that have arisen through critical examination.

Nemirow and Lewis present the "ability hypothesis", and Conee argues for the "acquaintance hypothesis". Both approaches attempt to demonstrate that Mary gains no new knowledge, but instead gains something else. If she in fact gains no new propositional knowledge, they contend, then what she does gain may be accounted for within the physicalist framework. These are the two most notable[citation needed] objections to Jackson's thought experiment, and the claim it sets out to make.

Design of the thought experiment [ edit ]

Some have objected to Jackson's argument on the grounds that the scenario described in the thought experiment itself is not possible. For example, Evan Thompson questioned the premise that Mary, simply by being confined to a monochromatic environment, would not have any color experiences, since she may be able to see color when dreaming, after rubbing her eyes, or in afterimages from light perception.[7] However, Graham and Horgan suggest that the thought experiment can be refined to account for this: rather than situating Mary in a black and white room, one might stipulate that she was unable to experience color from birth, but was given this ability via medical procedure later in life.[8] Nida-Rümelin recognizes that one might question whether this scenario would be possible given the science of color vision (although Graham and Horgan suggest it is), but argues it is not clear that this matters to the efficacy of the thought experiment, provided we can at least conceive of the scenario taking place.[3]

Objections have also been raised that, even if Mary's environment were constructed as described in the thought experiment, she would not, in fact, learn something new if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red. Daniel Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew "everything about color", that knowledge would necessarily include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the "qualia" of color. Moreover, that knowledge would include the ability to functionally differentiate between red and other colors. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that functional knowledge is identical to the experience, with no ineffable 'qualia' left over.[9] J. Christopher Maloney argues similarly:

If, as the argument allows, Mary does understand all that there is to know regarding the physical nature of colour vision, she would be in a position to imagine what colour vision would be like. It would be like being in physical state S k , and Mary knows all about such physical states. Of course, she herself has not been in S k , but that is no bar to her knowing what it would be like to be in S k . For she, unlike us, can describe the nomic relations between S k and other states of chromatic vision...Give her a precise description in the notation of neurophysiology of a colour vision state, and she will very likely be able to imagine what such a state would be like.[10]

Surveying the literature on Jackson's argument, Nida-Rümelin identifies, however, that many simply doubt the claim that Mary would not gain new knowledge upon leaving the room, including physicalists who do not agree with Jackson's conclusions. Most cannot help but admit that "new information or knowledge comes her way after confinement," enough that this view "deserves to be described as the received physicalist view of the Knowledge Argument."[3] Some philosophers have also objected to Jackson's first premise by arguing that Mary could not know all the physical facts about color vision prior to leaving the room. Owen Flanagan argues that Jackson's thought experiment "is easy to defeat". He grants that "Mary knows everything about color vision that can be expressed in the vocabularies of a complete physics, chemistry, and neuroscience," and then distinguishes between "metaphysical physicalism" and "linguistic physicalism":

Metaphysical physicalism simply asserts that what there is, and all there is, is physical stuff and its relations. Linguistic physicalism is the thesis that everything physical can be expressed or captured in the languages of the basic sciences…Linguistic physicalism is stronger than metaphysical physicalism and less plausible.

Flanagan argues that, while Mary has all the facts that are expressible in "explicitly physical language", she can only be said to have all the facts if one accepts linguistic physicalism. A metaphysical physicalist can simply deny linguistic physicalism and hold that Mary's learning what seeing red is like, though it cannot be expressed in language, is nevertheless a fact about the physical world, since the physical is all that exists.[11] Similarly to Flanagan, Torin Alter contends that Jackson conflates physical facts with "discursively learnable" facts, without justification:

...some facts about conscious experiences of various kinds cannot be learned through purely discursive means. This, however, does not yet license any further conclusions about the nature of the experiences that these discursively unlearnable facts are about. In particular, it does not entitle us to infer that these experiences are not physical events.[12]

Nida-Rümelin argues in response to such views that it is "hard to understand what it is for a property or a fact to be physical once we drop the assumption that physical properties and physical facts are just those properties and facts that can be expressed in physical terminology."[3]

Ability hypothesis [ edit ]

Several objections to Jackson have been raised on the grounds that Mary does not gain new factual knowledge when she leaves the room, but rather a new ability. Nemirow claims that "knowing what an experience is like is the same as knowing how to imagine having the experience". He argues that Mary only obtained the ability to do something, not the knowledge of something new.[13] Lewis put forth a similar argument, claiming that Mary gained an ability to "remember, imagine and recognize."[14] In the response to Jackson's knowledge argument, they both agree that Mary makes a genuine discovery when she sees red for the first time, but deny her discovery involves coming to know some facts of which she was not already cognizant before her release. Therefore, what she obtained is a discovery of new abilities rather than new facts; her discovery of what it is like to experience color consists merely in her gaining new ability of how to do certain things, but not gaining new factual knowledge. In light of such considerations, Churchland distinguishes between two senses of knowing, "knowing how" and "knowing that", where knowing how refers to abilities and knowing that refers to knowledge of facts. He aims to reinforce this line of objection by appealing to the different locations in which each type of knowledge is represented in the brain, arguing that there is a true, demonstratively physical distinction between them.[15]

In response, Levin argues that a novel color experience does in fact yield new factual knowledge, such as "information about the color's similarities and compatibilities with other colors, and its effect on other of our mental states."[16] Tye counters that Mary could have (and would have, given the stipulations of the thought experiment) learned all such facts prior to leaving the room, without needing to experience the color firsthand. For example, Mary could know the fact "red is more like orange than green" without ever experiencing the colors in question.[17]

Earl Conee objects that having an ability to imagine seeing a color is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see that color, meaning the ability hypothesis does not capture the nature of the new knowledge Mary acquires upon leaving the room. To show that ability is not necessary, Conee cites the example of someone who is able to see colors when she is looking at them, but who lacks the capacity to imagine colors when she is not. He argues that while staring at something that looks red to her, she would have knowledge of what it is like to see red, even though she lacks the ability to imagine what it is like. In order to show precisely that imaginative abilities are not sufficient for knowing what it is like, Conee introduces the following example: Martha, "who is highly skilled at visualizing an intermediate shade that she has not experienced between pairs of shades that she has experienced...happens not to have any familiarity with the shade known as cherry red". Martha has been told that cherry red is exactly midway between burgundy red and fire red (she has experienced these two shades of red, but not cherry). With this, Martha has the ability to imagine cherry red if she so chooses, but as long as she does not exercise this ability, to imagine cherry red, she does not know what it is like to see cherry red.[18]

One might accept Conee's arguments that imaginative ability is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see a color, but preserve a version of the ability hypothesis that employs an ability other than imagination. For example, Gertler discusses the option that what Mary gains is not an ability to imagine colors, but an ability to recognize colors by their phenomenal quality.[19]

Acquaintance hypothesis [ edit ]

Due to his dissatisfaction with the ability hypothesis, Earl Conee presents another variant. Conee's acquaintance hypothesis identifies a third category of knowledge, "knowledge by acquaintance of an experience," that is not reducible to factual knowledge nor to knowing-how. He argues that the knowledge Mary actually acquires post-release is acquaintance knowledge. Knowing an experience by acquaintance "requires the person to be familiar with the known entity in the most direct way that it is possible for a person to be aware of that thing". Since "experiencing a quality is the most direct way to apprehend a quality," Mary gains acquaintance with color qualia after release.[18] Conee thus defends himself against the knowledge argument like this:

Qualia are physical properties of experiences (and experiences are physical processes). Let Q be such a property. Mary can know all about Q and she can know that a given experience has Q before release, although—before release—she is not acquainted with Q. After release Mary gets acquainted with Q, but she does not acquire any new item of propositional knowledge by getting acquainted with Q (in particular she already knew under what conditions normal perceivers have experiences with the property Q).[3]

Tye also defends a version of the acquaintance hypothesis that he compares to Conee's, though he clarifies that acquaintance with a color should not be equated to applying a concept to one's color experience.[20]

In Conee's account, one can come to know (be acquainted with) a phenomenal quality only by experiencing it, but not by knowing facts about it as Mary did. This is different from other physical objects of knowledge: one comes to know a city, for example, simply by knowing facts about it. Gertler uses this disparity to oppose Conee's account: a dualist who posits the existence of qualia has a way of explaining it, with reference to qualia as different entities than physical objects; while Conee describes the disparity, Gertler argues that his physicalist account does nothing to explain it.[19]

The neural basis of qualia [ edit ]

V.S. Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard of the Center for Brain and Cognition at UCSD argue that Mary might do one of three things upon seeing a red apple for the first time:

Mary says she sees nothing but gray. She has the "Wow!" response from subjectively experiencing the color for the first time. She experiences a form of blindsight for color, in which she reports seeing no difference between a red apple and an apple painted gray, but when asked to point to the red apple, she correctly does.

They explain further: "Which of these three possible outcomes will actually occur? We believe we've learned the answer from a colorblind synesthete subject. Much like the theoretical Mary, our colorblind synesthete volunteer cannot see certain hues, because of deficient color receptors. However, when he looks at numbers, his synesthesia enables him to experience colors in his mind that he has never seen in the real world. He calls these "Martian colors." The fact that color cells (and corresponding colors) can activate in his brain helps us answer the philosophical question: we suggest that the same thing will happen to Mary."[21]

Ramachandran and Hubbard's contribution is in terms of exploring "the neural basis of qualia" by "using pre-existing, stable differences in the conscious experiences of people who experience synaesthesia compared with those who do not" but, they note that "this still doesn't explain why these particular events are qualia laden and others are not (Chalmers' 'hard problem') but at least it narrows the scope of the problem" (p. 25).[22]

Dualist responses [ edit ]

Jackson's argument is meant to support dualism, the view that at least some aspects of the mind are non-physical. Nida-Rümelin contends that, because dualism is relatively unpopular among contemporary philosophers, there are not many examples of dualist responses to the knowledge argument; nevertheless, she points out that there are some prominent examples of dualists responding to the Knowledge Argument worth noting.[3]

Jackson himself went on to reject epiphenomenalism, and dualism altogether. He argues that, because when Mary first sees red, she says "wow", it must be Mary's qualia that causes her to say "wow". This contradicts epiphenomenalism because it involves a conscious state causing an overt speech behavior. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. Jackson now believes that the physicalist approach (from a perspective of indirect realism) provides the better explanation. In contrast to epiphenominalism, Jackson says that the experience of red is entirely contained in the brain, and the experience immediately causes further changes in the brain (e.g. creating memories). This is more consilient with neuroscience's understanding of color vision. Jackson suggests that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world. In a similar argument, philosopher Philip Pettit likens the case of Mary to patients suffering from akinetopsia, the inability to perceive the motion of objects. If someone were raised in a stroboscopic room and subsequently 'cured' of the akinetopsia, they would not be surprised to discover any new facts about the world (they do, in fact, know that objects move). Instead, their surprise would come from their brain now allowing them to see this motion.

Despite a lack of dualist responses overall and Jackson's own change of view, there are more recent instances of prominent dualists defending the Knowledge Argument. David Chalmers, one of the most prominent contemporary dualists, considers Jackson's thought experiment to successfully show that materialism is false. Chalmers considers responses along the lines of the "ability hypothesis" objection (described above) to be the most promising objections, but unsuccessful: even if Mary does gain a new ability to imagine or recognize colors, she would also necessarily gain factual knowledge about the colors she now sees, such as the fact of how the experience of seeing red relates to the physical brain states underlying it. He also considers arguments that knowledge of what it is like to see red and of the underlying physical mechanisms are actually knowledge of the same fact, just under a different "mode of presentation", meaning Mary did not truly gain new factual knowledge. Chalmers rejects these, arguing that Mary still necessarily gains new factual knowledge about how the experience and the physical processes relate to one another, i.e. a fact about exactly what kind of experience is caused by those processes.[23] Nida-Rümelin defends a complex, though similar, view, involving properties of experience she calls "phenomenal properties".[24]

(from The Book of King Solomon)

An Experiment with Time “What exactly is Time?” asked King Solomon.

“The antechamber of Eternity,” said Melchizedek. Time may be more mysterious than we imagine. And for anyone wishing to explore that mystery, I would recommend a book—little-known today—entitled An Experiment with Time. Written by J. W. Dunne, a British engineer and philosopher (and gentleman—some of the experiment was conducted from an armchair in the library of his club), An Experiment with Time created a stir when published in 1927. Despite his assurances that it required “no previous knowledge of science, mathematics, philosophy, or psychology” and was “considerably easier to understand than are, say, the rules of Contract Bridge,” much of the book is abstruse. But the philosophical portions—which delve into ontology and epistemology, and employ such terms as infinite regress, retro-causality, and quantum-interconnectedness—may be skipped. At the core of the book is a simple experiment, which Dunne performs, explains, and urges the reader to repeat. Dunne had been bewildered by a series of precognitive dreams. In one of them, he had dreamt of the eruption of a volcano on a French island and the death of 4000 islanders. When the newspaper arrived, it headlined the eruption of Mount Pelée on Martinique and a death-toll of 40,000. Seemingly, the horrifying dream had been prompted by his later reading of the newspaper account. Of his predictive dreams, this one was the most dramatic; but all were perplexing. They seemed to violate rules far more fundamental than those of contract bridge. His experiences led Dunne to make a study of the relationship between time and dreaming. He went to sleep each night with a notebook and pencil under his pillow. And in the morning he quickly recorded his dreams, before they faded from memory. When he compared their images with the occurrences in his daily life, Dunne made a startling discovery. Generally, a dream derived its imagery from vivid or unusual happenings within a space of 24 hours—24 hours in either direction. That is to say, his dreams were influenced by events of both the past day and the next! Impossibly, they were “comprised of images of past experiences and images of future experiences blended together in approximately equal proportions.” Extending his study to the dreams of friends and relatives, Dunne found similar correlations. He realized that he had discerned a “hitherto overlooked peculiarity in the structure of Time.” And he concluded that the standard model of Time—a series of events flowing into the future—was simply a mode of human perception. Indeed, “past” and “future” were nothing more than artifacts of the waking mind. Beyond our daily experience existed a timeless Present. What was the significance of his findings? For one thing, Dunne pointed out, they provided an explanation for the curious phenomenon of déjà vu. (Why do we feel that something has happened before? Because we dreamt of it the previous night.) But more importantly, they supported belief in the immortality of the soul. For if Time was an illusion, Eternity was real. Can it be then? Are dreams a window into the nature of the cosmos? Can they afford us a glimpse into the meaning of existence? Can we explore the deepest of mysteries while dozing in bed (or lounging in an armchair at our club)? The reader may repeat Dunne’s experiment and decide for himself.                                                      0279160-641af1ab0703f9f1de8b91c69d49aebb.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011341 00000000000 015333  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.

THAT August day, John D. Rockefeller did his habitual nine holes in his lowest score ever, despite being interrupted with news of an antitrust judgment fining his company, Standard Oil, about a third of its $100m market value. The penalty was later thrown out. But a little under four years later, on May 15th 1911, Rockefeller, again out on the golf course, was told that the Supreme Court had found the firm guilty of antitrust violations, and ordered it to be broken up. “Buy Standard Oil,” he advised his playing partner. A good tip: its pieces proved to be worth far more apart than together.

The break-up of Standard Oil into 34 companies, among them those that became Exxon, Amoco, Mobil and Chevron, marked the birth of strong antitrust policy, in the United States and beyond. The Sherman Antitrust Act dated from 1890, but had so far proved largely toothless against America's “robber barons” (Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt and the like). In the 1890s the law had forced Standard Oil to alter some of its worst practices, and to move many operations from Ohio to New Jersey; but this had little real impact on the oil giant. By 1900, it controlled over 90% of the refined oil in the United States. The Sherman act came of age with that victory over Standard Oil in 1911. Notable wins followed: against American Tobacco (also in 1911), Alcoa (1945) and AT&T (1982), before the challenge to Microsoft during the 1990s.

What gave the Sherman act the power to blow Standard Oil apart was an explosive mixture of economics and politics that has accompanied antitrust policy ever since. The law sounds decisive, making it illegal to “monopolise, or attempt to monopolise, any part of the trade or commerce” among American states or with foreign countries. Yet on how to apply that in practice, Sherman is vague, leaving it to the courts to decide. The same is true of antitrust law elsewhere. European Union law bars “abuse of a dominant position”; Britain forbids acts contrary to the “public interest”. In each case, it is left to courts and policymakers to decide what action, if any, these words require.

Politics weighed more than economics in the Standard Oil case. The company might have escaped, as others with more political savvy, like US Steel, did, had it played its cards better. President Theodore Roosevelt had launched the antitrust suit; offering to support his re-election if he dropped it was not smart. Later moguls—ask Bill Gates—have paid a price for underestimating the politics of antitrust.

The economic case against Standard Oil was far from proven. Economists still argue whether its aggressive buying of rivals and cut-throat pricing accelerated or retarded the growth of the industry and the ready availability of cheap fuel. It was already being challenged by oil from Texas and Persia. Economic issues are often even trickier today: it is usually easy, with the aid of modern developments in economic theory, to make a plausible case both for and against any alleged monopoly. Little wonder that antitrust has become a lucrative job-creation scheme for economists, as each side hires an army of dismal scientists to prove its point.

Joseph Schumpeter's theory of “creative destruction”, now back in vogue, suggests that, in some circumstances, monopoly may stimulate innovation and thus boost economic growth. His notion is that an innovative firm that wins a monopoly then becomes complacent, and is displaced by a sharper rival, and so on. That, broadly, is what happened to IBM. Today Microsoft argues that its dominance in PC operating systems could be wiped out fast by a rival with a better technology. Another theory, of “contestable markets”, allows some, rather extreme, economists to claim that even a firm with a 100% market share is not a nasty monopolist: if it is the least bit inefficient or over-pricing, a more efficient rival will contest the market and may drive it out.

And then what is “the market” at issue? Is Coca-Cola, say, in the market for colas, for carbonated soft drinks, or for all liquid refreshments? In Europe, Formula One has a 100% monopoly of its kind of motor-racing; but viewers can always watch some other kind, or racehorses, or porn videos. There can be no clear-cut answer to that sort of argument. One thing, though, is clear. Many markets now stretch outside any one country. Increasingly, global antitrust regulation would make sense. Yet that may be far away. Witness even the EU, in theory a single market: it has an antitrust arm—but so do its member states. How many national politicians will readily hand over to some international body the chance to cut the local Rockefeller down to size?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279555-f8c0d6ad193b06bd948df400cc491b78.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001355 00000000000 015212  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The ZTE Star 3 - alleged renders of which leaked online a week ago - could come with a 4K display, making it the first such smartphone in the world, according to a new report out of China.

As per the report, the device could sport a 5.5-inch display with 2160 x 3840 resolution (pixel density of 806ppi), similar to the one Sharp announced a couple of months ago. In addition, the report also noted that the TFT Panel will make use of a special crystal structure which will not only reduce power consumption but also improve the strength of the display.

It is being said that the display on the Star 3 will be manufactured by China's BOE. Needless to say, none of this has been officially confirmed by the company, so take it with a pinch of salt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279586-db64132876368dacf65fe7f982ad90c3.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012773 00000000000 015165  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The US Supreme Court on Monday declared as unconstitutional a 2008 North Carolina law barring registered sex offenders from accessing commercial social media sites where minors may become members or create personal pages or profiles.

The justices ruled that the law, used to prosecute more than 1,000 registered sex offenders, was a breach of the First Amendment because "cyberspace" amounted to the "modern public square." The court said the North Carolina law, which bars sex offenders from sites like Facebook and Twitter, "enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of First Amendment speech it burdens."

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing (PDF) for the majority, added that the law was too broad.

While we now may be coming to the realization that the Cyber Age is a revolution of historic proportions, we cannot appreciate yet its full dimensions and vast potential to alter how we think, express ourselves, and define who we want to be. The forces and directions of the Internet are so new, so protean, and so far reaching that courts must be conscious that what they say today might be obsolete tomorrow. This case is one of the first this Court has taken to address the relationship between the First Amendment and the modern Internet. As a result, the Court must exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the First Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium.

The case was brought by Lester Packingham, who was convicted of having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 2002 when he was a 21-year-old college student. He served his time and registered as a convicted sex offender. As part of a Durham Police Department investigation into registered sex offenders, Packingham was prosecuted in 2010 for violating the statute but was given no prison time. He appealed the conviction on First Amendment grounds, all the way up to the Supreme Court.

Packingham broke the law when he took to Facebook to praise Jesus after he got a traffic ticket dismissed.

Man God is Good! How about I got so much favor they dismissed the ticket before court even started? No fine, no court cost, no nothing spent... Praise be to GOD, WOW! Thanks JESUS!

The high court noted that a "fundamental principle"—even one available to convicted sex offenders, is the First Amendment right to access "places where they can speak and listen, and then, after reflection, speak and listen once more."

Those places, the court concluded, include "Cyberspace."

"While, in the past, there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views, today the answer is clear. It is cyberspace," the court wrote, and "social media in particular."

Social media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another about it on any subject that might come to mind... By prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what, for many, are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge. These websites can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.

The justices were mindful to note that child exploitation is a most serious crime and an "act repugnant to the moral instances of a decent people."

The court majority continued and noted that, for centuries, new technologies and "inventions heralded as advances in human progress have been exploited by the criminal mind."

"So it will be with the Internet and social media," Kennedy wrote.

Kennedy was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Justice Samuel Alito, saying he was "troubled by the implications of the Court's unnecessary rhetoric," wrote separately in a concurring opinion joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. Justice Neil Gorsuch, the newest member of the court, took no part in the case.

Alito, in agreeing that "the law in question cannot satisfy the standard applicable to a content-neutral regulation," also wrote that the majority spoke too glowingly about the Internet.

"I cannot join the opinion of the Court, however, because of its undisciplined dicta. The Court is unable to resist musings that seem to equate the entirety of the Internet with public streets and parks," Alito wrote. "And this language is bound to be interpreted by some to mean that the States are largely powerless to restrict even the most dangerous sexual predators from visiting any Internet sites, including, for example, teenage dating sites and sites designed to permit minors to discuss personal problems with their peers."

The majority, however, countered that the law might also apply to sites "as varied" as Amazon.com, Washingtonpost.com and Webmd.com. The justices said the states are free to criminalize criminal behavior online, but they cannot bar sex offenders from participating in a swath of speech being conducted online.

"Though the issue is not before the Court, it can be assumed that the First Amendment permits a State to enact specific, narrowly tailored laws that prohibit a sex offender from engaging in conduct that often presages a sexual crime, like contacting a minor or using a website to gather information about a minor," Kennedy wrote.

Still, the Internet has become too much a part of society, and therefore the states cannot adopt blanket exclusions from social media, Kennedy concluded.     0279541-678201d2e379733ca271749d8f76dd9c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003423 00000000000 014730  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Kenny Florian has become the latest victim of a staph infection. Speaking on his twitter page, Florian had previously revealed that he had been suffering from burstitis in his knee prior to his headline fight with Takanori Gomi at UFN 21 at the end of March.

Unfortunately the injury, which causes the knee to swell, turned septic while Florian was on vacation in the Caribbean – his first holiday in several years.

“A staph infection in your knee & being in a third world country = not good,” the fighter post ruefully on April 9th.

A couple of days later he posted, “Last 2 days have been brutal. Staph infection has been extremely painful. Knee looks disgusting. Two distinct blisters of pus are forming.”

After returning home to Boston today Florian went to the hospital to get his knee checked out. Just an hour ago he then left the following post:

“Being admitted to the hospital. Not good. Minor surgery & IV antibiotics on the way. Damn!!”

The former No.1 contender in the lightweight division is certainly not the first MMA fighter to have troubles with staph infections. Unfortunately it’s an all-too-common complaint in MMA due to the bacteria thriving in places like gym mats, clothes and pads.

With Frankie Edgar becoming the new lightweight champion on Saturday night a new window of opportunity has opened up for Florian to potentially get his hands on the belt, and so he will no doubt be keeping his fingers crossed that his injury does not keep him out of action for long.

Along with his twitter posts in recent days, Ken-Flo also posted several pictures of his injury as it gradually became worse, and for those of you interested in that kind of thing you can see them for yourself below…

The administration initially rolled out a rough outline for a tax overhaul in April by mirroring its campaign pledge to cut the corporate rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. Since then, President Donald Trump has been peppering CEOs, aides and others in business with questions about how low the rate would need to be to help companies grow.

Story Continued Below

Some executives and business lobbyists have cited a rate in the 20s, one White House official said, and that has become a prevailing view among a number of senior officials and advisers.

“[Trump] is convinced the corporate rate is the only thing that really matters,” the official said, even though other aspects of the plan could determine how low the rate might go.

The White House is pushing tax reform as a policy area that it thinks it can drive and win. The president himself is engaged on the issue “far more than health care,” this person said.

The dynamics of the internal discussions on tax policy still could change, and the administration for now is publicly maintaining its target of 15 percent.

“The president set out the 15 percent as an ambitious goal post,” said another senior administration official, acknowledging that the final rate could actually be significantly higher. The intent of that approach was to start negotiations from a very low rate and hope to end up somewhere close to 20 percent, which is the rate House Republicans have proposed.

The White House and top congressional Republicans, mindful of mistakes that brought their Obamacare repeal efforts to the brink of failure, are taking a more methodical approach to tax reform in hopes of presenting a united front when legislation is rolled out.

A group of senior administration officials and leading lawmakers known as the Big Six is trying to dispose of tax reform’s big-picture questions after seeing messy policy fights plague the health care push.

Top Trump administration officials have been holding listening sessions for months with a range of interest groups. Trump is expected to hit the road next month to sell the GOP tax reform plans — which critics on the left have derided as a giveaway to the most fortunate — to his more blue-collar base. “I think you should always have a sense of urgency and start by helping people understand the why, and then the how gets clearer,” said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.).

Those involved and watching the tax reform process caution that there’s still a very good chance that Republicans could fail to overhaul the tax code. The Senate GOP’s health care difficulties illustrate how difficult it can be to get 50 out of 52 Republicans on board with major policy overhauls, and polls suggest that Trump’s tax framework isn’t very popular with voters.

Plus, many interest groups currently cheering the Republicans’ approach on tax reform will change their mind if their preferred policies don’t end up making the final cut.

Nonetheless, the overarching political dynamics on taxes will be different.

Republicans have so fervently opposed Obamacare for more than seven years that they had to do everything they could to repeal it once they got control of Washington, congressional aides say. But taxes have been one of the GOP’s signature issues for far longer. It’s a topic that, more than health care, interests a broad cross-section of Republicans, including the president, his economic deputies and K Street.

The administration appears more fully engaged on the issue, with Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — both alums of Goldman Sachs — making frequent trips to Capitol Hill.

“These are financial guys. They’re Wall Street guys,” one tax lobbyist said. “They care about taxes.”

Many close watchers of tax reform efforts also say that it looks like the White House and congressional leaders have devised a better rollout on the issue than they did on health care, even if Republicans have a ways to go on actually developing the policy.

The plan is still for those Big Six principals — Mnuchin, Cohn, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch — to finish their high-level work on tax reform by September, which would allow the two committees to fill in the details.

White House officials say Trump will hit the road before that work is done — though exactly where is still a work in progress. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that he expects that “there will be some activity in August and then into September” on tax reform.

Another White House staffer said Trump would focus on problems with the current tax system and the need for changing it before his deputies and congressional leaders finish their plan. That idea has fans both among the Big Six and lobbyists, some of whom say that it would be difficult to determine the tax policy if the grass roots aren’t motivated.

“It’s critical because Americans want to know we’re serious about delivering on pro-growth tax reform this year. They want to know the key principles that we’re proposing, and they want to have input in it,” Brady said.

At the same time, tax aides on the Hill are planning their own effort to lay the groundwork for tax reform. Brady said it was crucial for lawmakers to be home next month to make the pitch.

“August is all about tax reform,” one Hill staffer said.

Groups aligned with the conservative billionaire Koch brothers are helping push the White House message as well, with spending on advertising from Freedom Partners and Americans for Prosperity.

As part of the multimillion-dollar efforts on tax reform, AFP will conduct grass-roots education, direct mail, other forms of ads and events in its 36 chapter states.

Other outside groups are working to exert influence on the public as well, though not necessarily in partnership with the White House.

The Heritage Foundation, for example, has circulated research papers and published op-eds on its own. Similarly, FreedomWorks has been making the case for tax reform through op-eds and other initiatives, sometimes with partners, as part of its own educational outreach.

For example, the group has paired with the Job Creators Network on a tax reform promotion through August that may continue into September.

“After eight years of anemic economic growth, the time is now,” said Jason Pye, FreedomWorks’ vice president of legislative affairs.

However, as if to demonstrate the gaps still to be sealed, Americans for Prosperity issued a statement Monday condemning talk of imposing a minimum tax on the foreign earnings of U.S. multinationals. And it remains to be seen whether Trump can stay on message during his sales pitches.

Tax analysts believe that the Big Six’s work could help smooth the tax reform process, and the principals themselves have suggested that they’re making progress in their regular meetings.

But they haven’t said that they’ve worked through some of tax reform’s knottiest questions — like whether tax cuts should be fully offset. It’s a crucial question since Republicans plan to move tax reform through a budget process that restricts deficit increases.

Ryan and Brady also have yet to throw in the towel on their own blueprint, which includes the controversial border adjustment tax. The proposed tax, on imports, has faced steep opposition from Senate Republicans, retail groups and others.

“Everyone thinks tax is the easy thing right now. Wait until we get into it. There will be pain associated with this,” said one senior GOP aide.

Both the Senate and the Trump administration have started to exert more influence on the tax reform process in recent weeks, given all the troubles that the House GOP blueprint has faced. But that also hasn’t sat well with some House GOP tax writers, who complain about all the criticism their efforts absorbed while the White House and Senate failed to produce detailed alternatives.

“I think, in some ways, we’re frustrated that things aren’t moving fast enough but realizing that we’ve been in this game longer than almost anyone else, whether it be the White House, whether it be the Senate,” said Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.).

The report, Value and Values: Perceptions of Ethics in the City Today, was based on a survey of 515 people taken by market research company ComRes in August. It revealed that 66% of respondents believe City traders are paid too much. FTSE 100 chief executives, stockbrokers, lawyers and bankers were also considered overpaid.

Respondents were questioned about the ethics of their salaries and bonuses, corporate social responsibility and the history of the financial services sector.

Two-thirds of respondents said "salary and bonuses" were the most important motivation for financial services professionals, with "enjoyment of work" coming a distant second. The survey found that 75% agreed there was too great a gap between rich and poor in the UK. Just over half believed deregulation of financial markets resulted in less ethical behaviour.

Only 14% of respondents correctly recalled the motto of the London Stock Exchange – "Dictum Meum Pactum" (my word is my bond).

The thinktank is linked to St Paul's Cathedral in London, where protesters against corporate greed have been demonstrating since last month.

The publication of the report was postponed following the resignation of the canon chancellor of St Paul's, Giles Fraser, over the cathedral's handling of the protest camp. Fraser wrote in the introduction to the report: "The fact that trading is now so heavily mediated by technology and less reliant on direct human contact may go some way to explain how a sense of moral obligation has come to feel less compelling." Quoting the theologian Albert Schweitzer, Fraser wrote that "ethics is a state of solidarity with other human beings".

The Rev Michael Hampel, canon precentor of St Paul's Cathedral, said: "Action is a crucial goal of the protest camp outside St Paul's Cathedral. We hope that the telling findings of this report can provide a solid foundation for future engagement and highlight issues where action might be of mutual concern for all sides of the debate."

The survey, carried out between 30 August and 12 September, was commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of the financial Big Bang – the deregulation of the London stock market in 1986.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0279545-ff5f8d46a687c1e24142b516b02c0adf.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000023766 00000000000 015211  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The word “replication” has, of late, set many a psychologist’s teeth on edge. Experimental psychology is weathering a credibility crisis, with a flurry of fraud allegations and retracted papers. Marc Hauser, an evolutionary psychologist at Harvard University, left academe amid charges of scientific misconduct. Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel-Prize-winning psychologist at Princeton University, entered the fray in 2012 with a sharply worded email to his colleagues studying social priming. He warned of a “train wreck looming” that researchers would avoid only if they focused more diligently on replicating findings. And the journal Social Psychology devoted its most recent issue to replication – and failed to replicate a number of high-profile findings in social psychology.

Yet psychologists are not the worst offenders when it comes to replication, it turns out. That distinction might belong to education researchers, according to an article published today in the journal Educational Researcher.

Rarity of Replication

Only 0.13 percent of education articles published in the field’s top 100 journals are replications, write Matthew Makel, a gifted-education research specialist at Duke University, and Jonathan Plucker, a professor of educational psychology and cognitive science at Indiana University. In psychology, by contrast, 1.07 percent of studies in the field’s top 100 journals are replications, a 2012 study found.

Makel and Plucker searched the entire publication history of the top 100 education journals – ranked according to five-year impact factors -- for the term replicat*. They found that 221 of 164,589 total articles replicated a previous study. Just 28.5 percent were direct replications rather than conceptual replications. (Only direct replications, which repeat an experiment’s procedure, can disconfirm or bolster a previous study. Conceptual replications, on the other hand, use different methods to test the same hypothesis.)

What’s more, 48.2 percent of the replications were performed by the same research team that had produced the original study. Attempts to replicate an experiment failed more often if there was no author overlap. When the same authors who published the original study published a replication in the same journal, 88.7 percent of replications succeeded. (The figure dropped to 70.6 percent when the same authors published in a different journal.) By contrast, replications conducted by new authors succeeded 54 percent of the time.

Replications might be appearing in journals outside the top 100, but these outlets attract scant scholarly notice. And some replications may not declare themselves as such, and would not show up in a search. These masked replications, however, fail to “serve their full duty as a replication,” Makel said in an interview.

Replications are an essential part of validating scientific knowledge. They control for sampling errors and weed out fraud. A replication might show, for instance, that an educational intervention’s effects are less pronounced than a previous study contended.

So why do so few replications appear in education journals? The article, “Facts Are More Important Than Novelty: Replication in the Education Sciences,” argues that education journals routinely prize studies that yield novel and exciting results over studies that corroborate – or disconfirm – previous findings. Conducting replications, the researchers write, “is largely viewed in the social science research community as lacking prestige, originality, or excitement.”

Researchers may fear that doing replications will not get them published, promoted or even hired. Nor will replications win them research grants, they worry. A replication that succeeds merely bolsters something we already know. A replication that fails, on the other hand, does not on its own invalidate a previous finding.

Makel and Plucker, however, say that replication matters greatly. What’s at stake, they say, is education’s standing as a discipline. Dismissing replication, they write, “indicates a value of novelty over truth … and a serious misunderstanding of both science and creativity.”

Legitimizing a Discipline

“A lot of people have made much of the difference between the natural sciences and the social sciences,” Makel said. “I do not associate science with a content area. I associate science with a process. I believe that a great many researchers in the education field would view themselves as doing science.”

An understanding of education research as a science is fairly new, said Plucker, his co-author.

Education is “definitely not at the top of hierarchy, even within the social sciences,” Plucker said. “I don’t think it’s traditionally well-respected.”

But the year 2002, when the Bush administration and Congress created the Institute for Education Sciences as the Education Department’s research arm, was a turning point for the field, he said. The last decade or so has seen tremendous reform in K-12 education – and with it, calls for research to guide public policy. In addition, education researchers have more complete data systems. They can follow a student through an entire K-12 education.

“Just the quality, especially now, of the work being done by early-career people – I just think it’s light-years advanced from where we were even seven or eight years ago,” Plucker said. “I think a lot of people now see it as a true social science.”

Replication, he said, is the next step the discipline must take in order to better legitimize itself in the eyes of other researchers and the public.

“We have better data, we have better data systems,” he said. “Now that we have those things, we really need a culture of replication and data-sharing to move us to the next level and keep this positive trajectory. If we don’t have it, can the trajectory continue? Yeah, but it’ll be a lot harder. One major fraud allegation can knock you off that razor’s edge.”

The article begins and ends with reference to the astronomer Carl Sagan's adage that science requires a balance between openness to new ideas and "ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new." The homage might signal the aspirations the authors have for their discipline.

“When I talk to my friends in the natural sciences, they’re just baffled by how this is even a question or a controversy in psychology and education,” Makel said. “Replication is such a normal part of the process for them.”

The current “culture” of education research, he said, “puts a lot of emphasis on novelty. Whereas we’re saying, no, if we want to be respected as a scientific field we need to put more emphasis on fact.”

Neighboring fields in the social sciences – psychology, sociology, criminology – also suffer from a dearth of replications. But whereas psychology has weathered a number of fraud cases, the world of education research has had not a single fraud accusation in years, Plucker said. That’s a remarkable statistic, considering that conservative estimates place the number of educational researchers at 50,000 in the U.S. and 100,000 worldwide, according to the American Educational Research Association.

Education research’s spotless record is no accident, he said. It’s the result of scholars who aren’t checking each other’s work.

“I would love to believe that every single person doing education research around the world has ethics that are as pure as the driven snow,” Plucker said. “[But] the law of averages tells us there’s something out there.”

Without replication, he said, “we’ll never know which research sits on a foundation of stone and which sits on a foundation of sand.”

Replication can lead to bruised feelings, however. The failure of a group of researchers to replicate a study by Simone Schnall, a psychologist at the University of Cambridge, led to dueling blog posts. Brent Donnellan, a professor of psychology at Michigan State University, wrote that he and his team, in attempting to replicate Schnall's study, "encountered an epic fail." Schnall shot back with a blog post of her own, writing that the stream of requests for her data made her feel "like a criminal suspect who has no right to a defense." Commenting on her post, Daniel Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard, wrote: "Simone Schnall is Rosa Parks -- a powerless woman who has decided to risk everything to call out the bullies ... The replication police need to apologize."

Plucker said that "there's always going to be hurt feelings." Researchers just need to handle replication requests professionally and fairly. And if replication were more common, a request for data would not feel like an attack, Makel added.

What to Do?

Researchers act in the way the research community wants them to, Makel said. So the trick is to change community norms. The authors point to a few ideas.

Journals could revise editorial policies to explicitly welcome the submission of replication studies. Journals could also reserve a portion of their page space for replication research. And the government should require that research submitted to the Education Department’s What Works Clearinghouse (a review of research on “what works” in education) be directly replicated, preferably by an independent research team.

Funding, too, will play a role. “If funders set aside dollars for replications specifically … researchers would apply for that money and do that research,” Makel said.

Not every study needs to be replicated, though. “The vast majority of education research does not need to be replicated,” Makel said. “The things that need to be replicated are the things that are having an influence on society. If we can’t confirm our own results then we lose the public trust and any credibility we hope to have on influencing policy.”

Plucker said he’d like replications to make up 10 percent of all published research – though he admits that’s unrealistic, at least now. “The amount we have now rounds down to zero pretty easily,” he said. “We need to get it at least in the 3 to 5 percent range.”          0279583-fbe8b77ee709734df44d9d88beefa8d8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011466 00000000000 015503  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        No one can argue that Pope Francis deserves a little break. Since taking office in March 2013, the 77-year-old Argentinian has been on the move almost nonstop greeting his adoring public and reforming the Vatican’s many troubled institutions.

But an announcement by the Vatican’s news service on Monday that the pope will be drastically curtailing his schedule by suspending his popular Wednesday audiences in July and skipping his daily Mass at the Casa Santa Marta, where he lives, has many in Rome wondering if the pope is really OK.

Many people already have tickets for the July audiences, which implies that the decision to suspend them was spontaneous, not preplanned. Several Vatican insiders also have noted that the pope is gaining weight and breathing harder than usual, which has caused some of his close associates to warn him to slow down. “Some in the Holy See are beginning to openly discuss concerns about Francis’ condition and asking if the Holy Father is overtaxing himself,” longtime Vatican correspondent Edward Pentin wrote after the surprising changes to the pope’s schedule.

The worries began last week, when the pope spontaneously canceled his Monday and Tuesday engagements after his historic trip to the Holy Land and Peace prayer with leaders from Israel and Palestine, sending the Vatican press corps in Rome into a minor moment of panic. This week’s announcement of his amended schedule has only added to the speculation that the pope’s health is suffering.

Francis, who only has one functioning lung after having part of his other lung removed due to an infection when he was younger, has been noticeably tired in recent weeks. “Close observers are noting that the Pope’s physical body may be failing to keep up with his youthful energy and vigor, especially considering he only has one fully functioning lung,” says Pentin.

By some estimates, Francis has gained as much as 20 pounds since taking office, likely because his physical activity has diminished, even though his scheduled has intensified. “His repeated fatigue reports and weight gain suggest he may be slipping into a form of chronic heart failure common among victims of significant lung disorders,” Dr. Peter Hibberd told Newsmax. “His immunity will be challenged when under stress, and more frequent pauses to recover from otherwise small insults—such as colds, sore throats, and minor injuries—can be expected to increase in the future unless he paces himself.”

There are no reports whether the pope has been forced to use an inhaler or take extra oxygen to help him breathe in Rome’s stifling humid summer weather, but there is rampant speculation in Rome that part of the reason he is going undercover in July is because whatever is ailing him can’t easily be hidden. Papal confidante Cardinal Telesphonre Placidus Toppo of India told Italy’s Libero newspaper that he found the pope “very tired and fatigued” after spending time with him. “I honestly do not know how long he might be able to sustain this pace that he’s certainly not accustomed to,” Toppo told the paper.

The Vatican has played down concerns for the pope, saying last week the pope cancelled his appointments due to a slight “indisposition” and that it was “not serious.” Unlike his predecessors John Paul II and Benedict XVI, Francis will not be spending the summer in Castel Gandolfo outside of Rome, but will instead be working from his offices in Vatican City, albeit out of the public view except on Sundays when he will continue to bless the crowds who gather in St. Peter’s square at noon for his weekly Angelus—a practice that even the ailing John Paul II was able to manage until the final days of his life. Francis’s next major public appointment is now a trip to South Korea scheduled for August 13—18.

The Vatican may be brushing off concern, but even Francis seems to be fully aware of his immortality. During an a visit to the Sant Egidio charity in Rome’s Trastevere district on Sunday, the pope braved torrential rainstorms to greet the poor, and finished the event by asking the crowds to pray for him. “My work is unhealthy, extraordinary work and I need prayer,” he said.

And last week, when he was asked he took risks by traveling through massive crowds without the bullet-proof “sardine can” pope mobile during an interview with Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia , he said he left his fate in God’s hands. “It’s true that anything could happen,” the pontiff replied. “But let’s face it, at my age I don’t have much to lose.”

If Atari Isn't a Japanese Company, Why Does it Have a Japanese Name?

by Joel Miller



The name ATARI is in fact a Japanese word, but the company is most definitely American. The evolution of the name ATARI is interesting and somewhat complicated. To get to the root of it, we spoke with Ted Dabney, one of the founders.



In the beginning, three friends, who knew each other from previously working at Ampex, decided to invent and market the first commercially feasible video game. They were Nolan Bushnell, Ted Dabney and Larry Bryan. To become a partner, each had to ante up $100--unbelievable today considering ATARI's success! The three were all sitting around Bushnell's house one day, drinking beer and trying to figure out a name for their new company. Bryan was thumbing through the dictionary and came upon an interesting last listing in the "S" section: Syzygy--"the straight-line configuration of three celestial bodies." What a perfect name, they thought, for a company begun by three so obviously astronomically talented people...



They invented the game Computer Space. Things became a little shaky and Bryan didn't ante up his $100. Only Bushnell and Dabney remained. They set up shop in Santa Clara, California and incorporated the business. A little later, they invented Pong.



Bushnell and Dabney applied for the name Syzygy, but the Office of the California Secretary of State, which regulates California corporations, informed them that this name had already been taken by another California corporation. As this corporation didn't appear to be active, they tried to buy the rights to the name; however, they were unsuccessful. Their attorney told them to identify a new corporate name. They considered "BD, Inc." and "DB, Inc." but these names too closely resembled Black & Decker Manufacturing Inc. or Dunn and Bradstreet Inc.



Bushnell and Dabney were both players of Go, a Japanese strategy game. Their best brainstorming always occurred over beer and a good game of Go. Being preoccupied with Go at the moment, they decided to make a list of several Go words and see if one of them would fly as the new corporate name.



First on the list was "Sente," which means "the upper hand." Their second and third choices were "Atari," which has similar meaning to the chess word "check" and "Hanne," the acknowledgement of an overtaking move.



Bushnell and Dabney submitted the list to the Office of the California Secretary of State. A few weeks later, their incorporation papers came back; the Office of the Secretary had selected their second choice, ATARI. If someone in the Office of the Secretary of State had decided to approve their first choice, you might now be reading "THE SENTE CONNECTION."



When the name changed, Bushnell and Dabney wanted to change the logo too. So they incorporated both the "S" from Syzygy and the "A" from ATARI into the new design. If you look closely at the middle logo, you'll see both letters. Some time later, as the company became more successful, an advertising agency designed the slicker and now famous ATARI logo, the ATARI "fuji" or stylized "A" design.

Columbia University professor of journalism Todd Gitlin writes (“The Left Declares Its Independence,” New York Times, October 8th) “the core of the [Occupy] movement … consists of what right-wing critics call anarchists.” Rather than taking the same snide, dismissive approach to anarchism typical of the news media and academia, he goes on to observe that “[t]he culture of anarchy is right,” that the interests of “[t]he corporate rich” largely control both major American political parties.

Gitlin describes contemporary anarchism accurately (if generally) as “a theory of self-organization,” one opposed to a plutocracy of elites who have “artfully arranged a mutual back-scratching society to enrich themselves.” For my life, I can’t think of a better way to describe the way that the state and capital work together against the common man and genuine free markets.

Gitlin is surprisingly genial toward anarchism, or at least toward his own image of it, but anarchists are still widely regarded as agents of chaos. The question: Why?

I’ve always been of the general opinion that the project of science itself is inherently subversive, dangerous to established ways and their guardians. Science, the quest for truth with its empirical and rational methods, explodes our preconceptions and offers us glimpses at the workings of a reality that still seems little understood and out of reach.

If the subatomic particle did not spring into being when human beings discovered it, but was always there, then we must wonder what kinds of marvels — today only the subjects of science fiction — will soon be revealed as truths. Of today’s ideas, we must wonder too which of them that are now the in realm of the eccentric or kook are in fact that wave of the future.

Through the history of the idea, and even before there was a name to designate it, anarchism’s adherents found it through a range of paths. Nineteenth century American anarchist Benjamin Tucker labeled his ideas “scientific anarchism,” the natural and inevitable result of consistently recognizing the “Sovereignty of the Individual.”

Albert R. Parsons, another American anarchist, similarly called anarchism “the usher of science,” setting it in opposition to schools of thought that “considered [some ideas] too sacred to be disturbed by a close investigation.” I offer these examples not to show that all anarchists share the same view of their doctrine’s relationship with the scientific method, but rather to gainsay what I suppose is an assumption held in common by many who read this.

None of the standard caricatures prevailing today about anarchists are any more accurate in characterizing them than are similarly uninformed reader’s digest versions of other philosophical persuasions. There are, to be sure, anomalous and unrepresentative nutcases and genuine criminals circulating among the ranks of all the various “-isms,” yet special derision is reserved for anarchists.

But again, why? Market anarchists believe simply that relationships between people ought to be consensual and based upon the foundation of mutual respect, that a true free market means that no person or group has special privileges fashioned by coercion and violence. Details vary among anarchists — and are as fiercely and thoughtfully debated as in other circles — but all harbor a conscientious objection (if I may borrow the phrase) to the state’s actual, physical domination and displacement of voluntary society.

The state is merely an idea, one way of thinking about given social questions, and one that would appear as true and as unavoidable today as, for instance, the geocentric model in astronomy. And while history has vindicated the likes of Copernicus and Galileo with respect to their judgments of that model, we nevertheless think it impossible that anarchists could be correct in their criticisms of the current system.

The anarchists I know, quite contrary to the conventional wisdom, do not oppose the state out of some erratic, unformed reflex reaction against authority. Indeed, the natural instinct in favor of freedom that I believe humans have has been very meticulously trained out of us from the time we enter the total state’s K-12 propaganda mills.

Instead, anarchism is for its advocates — in the words of Edward Abbey — “not a romantic fable but [a] hard-headed realization,” an embrace of empirical reality rather than an avoidance of it. The protesters of the Occupy movement are yearning for an alternative; anarchism is the scientific one, the substantive argument against politics and economies based on violence and oppression. The death of the state is no more scary or dangerous than the death of the idea that the earth is flat.

Kudos to Google for refusing to bow down to Joe Lieberman's attempts to censor youtube. It's a slippery slope one starts down when one starts to censor and Lieberman seems happy to grease the slide with his efforts.

The NY Times writes, today,

The Internet is simply a means of communication, like the telephone, but that has not prevented attempts to demonize it — the latest being the ludicrous claim that the Internet promotes terrorism. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut is trying to pressure YouTube to pull down videos he does not like, and a recent Senate report and a bill pending in Congress also raise the specter of censorship. It is important for online speech to be protected against these assaults. - Advertisement - Mr. Lieberman recently demanded that YouTube take down hundreds of videos produced by Islamist terrorist organizations or their supporters. YouTube reviewed the videos to determine whether they violated its guidelines, which prohibit hate speech and graphic or gratuitous violence. It took down 80 videos, but left others up. Mr. Lieberman said that was “not enough,” and demanded that more come down. Earlier this month, the Senate homeland security committee, which is led by Mr. Lieberman, issued a report titled “Violent Islamist Extremism, the Internet, and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat.” The report identified the Internet as “one of the primary drivers” of the terrorist threat to the United States. All of this comes against the backdrop of a troubling Congressional antiterrorism bill that also focuses on the Internet. The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act, which passed the House last year by a 404-to-6 vote, would establish a commission to study the terrorist threat and propose legislation. The bill, which the Senate has not acted on, has a finding that the Internet promotes radicalization and terrorism. - Advertisement -

The NY Times reports that the committee didn't call for restricting free speech, but did discuss the need for “what, if any, new laws” should be enacted. The Times concludes, "no new laws are needed — or justifiable — any more than it would be tolerable to enact laws restricting speech over the telephone, in a newspaper or a book, on a street corner, or in a church, mosque or synagogue."

Just as many right wing supporters are willing to give up their rights to privacy, usuall, with the explanation that they personally have nothing to hide, this approach to cutting into the essential right to free expression could be defended by suggesting that people who are not terrorists have nothing to worry about. This is incredibly dangerous. As the loyal opposition, in a time when opposition has been attacked as unpatriotic or even aiding the enemy, entering this slippery censorship slope could lead to the squelching of all protest.

TheTimes concludes,

Not only do these efforts contradict fundamental American values, it is not clear if they would help fight terrorism. Even if YouTube pulled down every video Mr. Lieberman did not like, radical groups could post the same videos on their own Web sites. Trying to restrain the Internet is a game of “whack-a-mole” that cannot be won, says John Morris of the Center for Democracy and Technology. Having the videos on YouTube may even be a good thing, because it makes it easier for law enforcement officials, the media and the public to monitor the groups and their messages. Terrorism is a real concern. All Americans know that. They also know that if we give up our fundamental rights, the terrorists win. If people use speech to engage in criminal acts, they should be prosecuted. Cutting off free speech is never the right answer.

Lieberman is really going further and further in taking the place of neanderthalcon Zell Miller, the most toxic, offensive troglodyte faux "Democrat" the senate has seen in recent years. Unfortunately, there are plenty more of his type, not quite as bad, but almost equally willing to shed the values and principles of Democracy. In the house, they call themselves Bluedogs. Fortunately, there are many in the blogosphere who are taking these sellout right wing faux Dems on. Donna Edwards did it in Maryland and that should just be the beginning.

Unfortunately, the last three debacles for Republicans, where they lost long held Republican congressional seats, the Dems who won them are Bluedog types. Sure, it's an improvement, but it also changes the composition of the Democratic party, making it more conservative. It is, therefore, essential, that progressives take aggressive action to push the party to the left. Failure to do so will actually allow MORE people like Joe LIeberman gain influence in congress. That would be bad news in a year when there should be a lot of good news.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0279585-59f1dd48fea7c38a8d2c253f0144c967.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000025063 00000000000 015152  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        by Adam Armstrong

Micron 5100 MAX SSD Review

Earlier this year, Micron launched its new 5100 SSD family of data center drives. The family had three flavors of drives, the ECO for read-intensive workloads such as video streaming, the PRO for latency-sensitive transactional databases, and the MAX for write-intensive logging applications. In January we reviewed the ECO, finding that while it lacked in performance in some of our workloads, it did offer things such as up to 8TB (making it an ideal HDD replacement) and FlexPro firmware. For this review we will be looking at the 5100 MAX.

The MAX has been designed specifically for write-intensive applications and has much higher endurance than the ECO. All of the 5100 series come with built-in AES-256 bit encryption and TCG enterprise protection. The MAX drives also come with FIPS 140-2 validation. As with the rest of the 5100 series, the MAX can be optimized through Micron’s FlexPro firmware.

Micron 5100 MAX specifications:

Form factor: 2.5”

NAND: Micron 3D eTLC

Capacity: 240GB, 480GB, 960GB, 1.92TB,

Interface: SATA 6Gb/s

Endurance DWPD: 5 TBW: 2.2-17.6PB MTTF: 2M

Performance Sequential read performance (128K): 540MB/s Sequential write performance (128K): 310-520MB/s Random read performance (4K): 93,000 IOPS Random write performance (4K): 48,000-74,000 IOPS



Design and Build

The Micron 5100 MAX has a very similar design to the ECO, in fact they are nearly identical. The drive is housed in a dark blue aluminum case with a large sticker taking up most of the real estate on the front with information such as model, capacity, and so on. The back of the drive is mostly blank with tamper proof stinkers on the corners.

Taking off of the cover reveals the PCB with 8 Micron NAND packs on the top.

The other side of the PCB has 8 more NAND packs as well as the Micron controller and DRAM.

Testing Background and Comparables

The StorageReview Enterprise Test Lab provides a flexible architecture for conducting benchmarks of enterprise storage devices in an environment comparable to what administrators encounter in real deployments. The Enterprise Test Lab incorporates a variety of servers, networking, power conditioning, and other network infrastructure that allows our staff to establish real-world conditions to accurately gauge performance during our reviews.

We incorporate these details about the lab environment and protocols into reviews so that IT professionals and those responsible for storage acquisition can understand the conditions under which we have achieved the following results. None of our reviews are paid for or overseen by the manufacturer of equipment we are testing. Additional details about the StorageReview Enterprise Test Lab and an overview of its networking capabilities are available on those respective pages.

Comparables for this review:

As the capacity and performance for SATA and SAS drives increase, StorageReview has pivoted to a more aggressive testing regimen for individual SSDs. This testing process is mirrored across NVMe products as well, making the comparison process easier--even though products perform in vastly different classes at the top-end. In this review, we compare the Micron MAX to the Micron Eco and 1.92TB Toshiba HK4R, as well as three additional SAS3 products that help set a high-performance reference point. As more drives come into the test lab with a capacity greater than 1.2TB, we will continue to add comparables into this group.

Application Workload Analysis

In order to understand the performance characteristics of enterprise storage devices, it is essential to model the infrastructure and the application workloads found in live production environments. Our first benchmarks for the Micron 5100 MAX are therefore the MySQL OLTP performance via SysBench and Microsoft SQL Server OLTP performance with a simulated TCP-C workload. For our application workloads, each drive will be running 2-4 identically configured VMs.

SQL Server Performance

Each SQL Server VM is configured with two vDisks: 100GB volume for boot and a 500GB volume for the database and log files. From a system resource perspective, we configured each VM with 16 vCPUs, 64GB of DRAM and leveraged the LSI Logic SAS SCSI controller. While our Sysbench workloads tested previously saturated the platform in both storage I/O and capacity, the SQL test is looking for latency performance.

This test uses SQL Server 2014 running on Windows Server 2012 R2 guest VMs, being stressed by Dell's Benchmark Factory for Databases. StorageReview’s Microsoft SQL Server OLTP testing protocol employs the current draft of the Transaction Processing Performance Council’s Benchmark C (TPC-C), an online transaction-processing benchmark that simulates the activities found in complex application environments. The TPC-C benchmark comes closer than synthetic performance benchmarks to gauging the performance strengths and bottlenecks of storage infrastructure in database environments. Each instance of our SQL Server VM for this review uses a 333GB (1,500 scale) SQL Server database and measures the transactional performance and latency under a load of 15,000 virtual users.

SQL Server Testing Configuration (per VM)

Windows Server 2012 R2

Storage Footprint: 600GB allocated, 500GB used

SQL Server 2014 Database Size: 1,500 scale Virtual Client Load: 15,000 RAM Buffer: 48GB

Test Length: 3 hours 2.5 hours preconditioning 30 minutes sample period



When looking at SQL Server Output, the 5100 MAX had the lowest individual scores, ranging from 2,440.9 to 2,565.4 TPS, as well as the lowest aggregate score of 5,006.2 TPS.

Average latency showed the 5100 MAX again place at the bottom with individual VMs placing as high as 1,107ms and 1,404ms and an aggregate score of 1,256ms.

Sysbench Performance

The next application benchmark consists of a Percona MySQL OLTP database measured via SysBench. This test measures average TPS (Transactions Per Second), average latency, and average 99th percentile latency as well.

Each Sysbench VM is configured with three vDisks: one for boot (~92GB), one with the pre-built database (~447GB), and the third for the database under test (270GB). From a system resource perspective, we configured each VM with 16 vCPUs, 60GB of DRAM and leveraged the LSI Logic SAS SCSI controller.

Sysbench Testing Configuration (per VM)

CentOS 6.3 64-bit

Percona XtraDB 5.5.30-rel30.1 Database Tables: 100 Database Size: 10,000,000 Database Threads: 32 RAM Buffer: 24GB

Test Length: 3 hours 2 hours preconditioning 32 threads 1 hour 32 threads



In the average transactions-per-second benchmark, the 5100 MAX was able to outperform its ECO brethern with individual VMs ranging from 424.4 TPS to 445 TPS and an aggregate score of 1,770.4 TPS.

Looking at average Sysbench VM latency, we measured individual VMs between 70.2ms to 75.4ms and an aggregate of 72.3ms putting it near the bottom.

In terms of our worst-case MySQL latency scenario (99th percentile latency), the 5100 MAX placed slightly better with individual VMs ranging from 128.6ms to 136.2ms and an aggregate score of 131.1ms.

Enterprise Synthetic Workload Analysis

Flash performance varies as the drive becomes conditioned to its workload, meaning that flash storage must be preconditioned before each of the fio synthetic benchmarks in order to ensure that the benchmarks are accurate. Each of the comparable drives are preconditioned into steady-state with a heavy load of 16 threads and an outstanding queue of 16 per thread.

Preconditioning and Primary Steady-State Tests:

Throughput (Read+Write IOPS Aggregate)

Average Latency (Read+Write Latency Averaged Together)

Max Latency (Peak Read or Write Latency)

Latency Standard Deviation (Read+Write Standard Deviation Averaged Together)

Once preconditioning is complete, each device is then tested in intervals across multiple thread/queue depth profiles to show performance under light and heavy usage. Our synthetic workload analysis for the RI SATA SSDs focuses on one profile, our 8K 70/30 mixed random workload It is important to take into consideration that synthetic workloads will never 100% represent the activity seen in production workloads, and in some ways inaccurately portray a drive in scenarios that wouldn't occur in the real world.

8k 70% Read/30% Write



FIO Host

Supermicro SuperServer 2028U-TNR4T+ Dual Intel E5-2699 v3 CPUs (2.3GHz, 18-cores, 45MB Cache) 768GB RAM (32GB x 24 DDR4, 384GB per CPU) CentOS 7.2 Supermicro AOC-S3008L-L8i HBA



​Our 8k benchmark uses a ratio of 70% read operations and 30% write operations. In our throughput test the Micron 5100 MAX ran at the top from begining to end, peaking at 47,045 IOPS.

Looking at average latency, the Micron 5100 MAX was again the best performer, very narrowly beating at the other drives throughout.

Max latency had the 5100 MAX saw a few large spikes and ended up in second.

With standard deviation, we we a repeat of average latency with the 5100 MAX being the best performer beating other drives by a hair.

Conslusion

The Micron 5100 MAX is the write-intensive, higher endurance SATA SSD in the 5100 series. The 5100 MAX has a range of capacities from 240GB to 1.92TB. and comes with FlexPro firmware giving users some ability to customize their usage. Like all of the 5100 Series, the MAX has built-in AES-256 bit encryption and TCG enterprise protection, but the MAX also comes with FIPS 140-2 validation.

The Micron 5100 MAX SSD has much more endurance than the other drives in the series but it didn't translate into higher performance in our application workload analysis. In our benchmarks the MAX had an aggregate score of 5,006.2 TPS and 1,256ms latency in SQL Server. Performance has overall better in Sysbench with an aggregate score of 1,770.4 TPS, an aggregate latency of 72.3ms, and a worst-case scenario latency of 131.1ms.

We also looked at synthetic with the Micron 5100 MAX where the drive performed much better. Only looking at 8k 70/30, we saw the 5100 MAX be the top performer in throughput, average latency, and standard deviation. The only benchmark was the MAX didn’t take the first spot, max latency, the drive did land in second. Overall while we weren't pleased with its application-level performance in our specific tests, the synthetic data does show the drive has potential in other areas.

Pros

High endurance

Secure options including FIPS 140-2

Strong Synthetic performance

Cons

Overall poor application workload analysis performance

The Bottom Line

The Micron 5100 MAX is a SATA SSD for data centers were endurance for write-intensive tasks are paramount; balanced with an approachable price point.

The lengthy ridgeline is named Pine Mountain Ridge with two prominent points along the ridge named Reyes Peak (7,514 ft) and Haddock Mountain (7,431 ft). Most of the ridge is located within the Sespe Wilderness of Los Padres National Forest, a 219,700 acre wilderness established in 1992 and includes Sespe Creek, the last remaining undammed river in southern California. A 53,000 acre portion of the wilderness is designated as the Sespe Condor Sanctuary to protect California condors in the Condor re-introduction and recovery program. While Reyes Peak is the highest point along Pine Mountain Ridge, Haddock Mountain is more rugged in character with steep cirques and picturesque cliffs on the south side of the ridge. Haddock Mountain is also the more remote summit requiring a four mile hike from the trailhead. Typical of high mountains in southern California, the south side of the ridge transitions to chaparral fairly rapidly while the north side is a lush ecosystem of pine and fir forest for several thousand feet to canyons below, including Beartrap Creek Canyon and Piedra Blanca Creek Canyon. Deep within this canyon lies the Gene Marshall Piedra Blanca National Recreation Trail which I’d like to run in the future. From the trailhead, we took the maintained trail through the beautiful pine forest to Haddock Mountain. The trail largely stays on the north side of the ridge where it tends to be shady with the occasional section along the ridge crest with excellent views to Haddock Mountain. From Haddock Mountain, views to the north include Mount Pinos and the Cuyama Badlands while views to the south include the Sespe Wilderness and coastal mountains of Santa Barbara and Ventura County. Mount Pinos to the north is a substantially higher summit reaching above 8,800 ft and is high enough to support cross country skiing in the winter. However, the terrain of the Mount Pinos massif is more gentle in nature. On the way back, we left the maintained trail and took use paths up the east ridge of Reyes Peak to its summit. A lookout used to exist above the summit rocks but all that remains now is the foundation posts. From Reyes Peak, the Reyes Peak Trail leads down to the west side of Reyes Peak to near the trailhead. Pine Mountain Ridge is a gem of interior Ventura County and certainly exceeded expectations. I look forward to exploring other parts of the Sespe Wilderness including the Gene Marshall Piedra Blanca Trail and the Sespe Hot Springs.

We have told you on innumerable occasions that in September Barack Hussein Obama will be leading a major effort at the United Nations to open our gates even wider for hundreds of thousands of third world migrants to be placed in your towns. (We learned yesterday that ORR is gearing up to take care of over 200,000 “humanitarian arrivals.”)

September is also the month when the Administration (Obama and Sec. of State Kerry) will make their final determination for the US Refugee Admissions Program and submit their plan for fiscal year 2017. They said last year that they were shooting for 100,000 refugees for FY17, but we expect the number to be much higher.

The buck stops with Speaker Paul Ryan!

And, frankly there is only one person who is now in the catbird seat to stop them this fall!—Speaker Paul Ryan. (I know your hearts are sinking, but that is the cold hard truth.) Only Congress can stop them by not granting the money needed to place hundreds of thousands of needy people, some from countries that hate us, in over 200 American towns (through 350 subcontractor offices).



Now here they go attempting to soften up Congress by rallying in Washington for refugees on August 28th!

They are promoting their rally as a “collective voice against intolerance!” From DCRally4Refugees (hat tip: Cathy):

In the midst of the greatest refugee crisis since WWII, advocates from across the country will gather at DCRally4Refugees, August 28, 2016 at the outdoor Sylvan Theater at the Washington Monument on the National Mall in Washington, DC, 10:00 AM – 2:30 PM (rain or shine).

The rally will raise awareness about the magnitude of the global refugee crisis, encourage advocacy and U.S. action to alleviate suffering through relief efforts and support, and stand in solidarity with refugees and displaced people worldwide. Anyone is encouraged to join the #SeaOfOrange, buy a T-shirt, attend the historic rally and use #DCRally4Refugees to show support.

Steps from the U.S. Capitol, DCRally4Refugees will call on the U.S. to provide more refugee resettlement and increased support to countries and organizations already involved, support proven relief efforts overseas, and offer resources for those who wish to help, raising a collective voice against intolerance. [Message is clear, if you are concerned about the economic costs and the security for your community you are a hateful, intolerant boob!—ed]



Please read their website carefully. They want people to attend (obviously), but they also want the Open Borders agitators across the country to send postcards to Congress, send money to them (LOL! through the already massively funded Tides Foundation) and to buy their orange T-shirts (these are master marketers!).

Here is the postcard they have prepared for their people to send to Congress. If you can’t read the list of supporting groups click on the link above. Most of the major federal resettlement contractors are listed. And, although there are other Catholic groups, I’m not seeing the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (hmmm?). What is up with that? Are you giving them too much guff in your parishes?

I still have a hard time understanding how decent concerned Christians and Jews have joined the globalists and are willing to help multinational corporations import cheap (slave!) labor! (Confirmed on my 30 day tour of the heartland).

Go here and see that they are also planning events around the country!

Only two things you must do now!

So here are the primary things you need to do in the coming weeks (in addition to putting out fires where you live)—tell Speaker Ryan and your member of Congress to cut the funding for any expansion of the UN/US State Department Refugee Admissions Program and elect Donald Trump as the next President of the United States.                                                                                                           0279595-f59772e4149c2daeb4109ffbdf6ec8ac.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007665 00000000000 015461  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Army Pfc.

The Army private accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of military and diplomatic documents to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks is expected to testify in court for the first time as early as Wednesday, part of an attempt by his attorney to convince a judge that his earlier pre-trial confinement was unlawful.

Supporters of Pfc. Bradley Manning, 24, have alleged that he was mistreated while held in the brig at Marine Corps Base Quantico, where he was kept in solitary confinement for more than eight months beginning in August 2010.

Manning faces 22 charges, ranging from the use of unauthorized software on a classified computer to aiding the enemy. If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.

Manning’s attorney, David Coombs, has filed a motion asking the judge to dismiss the charges against him or reduce any sentence that is rendered because of the alleged mistreatment.

During his solitary confinement, Manning was stripped of his clothes and not allowed bed sheets or a pillow, and was kept in his cell for 23 hours a day. Military officials have said they imposed the strictest conditions on the soldier because they considered him a suicide risk.

Protesters continued through the afternoon, vandalizing downtown businesses, smashing storefront glass windows and setting office furniture ablaze.

Coombs argues that although his client was deemed a suicide risk when he arrived at Quantico in July 2010, officials there recommended he be taken off “prevention-of-injury” status and out of maximum custody two months later. Despite those recommendations, Manning was held in solitary confinement until April, 2011.

The proceedings at Fort Meade began Tuesday and are expected to last several days. It is unclear exactly when Manning will testify.

Retired Col. Daniel Choike, the garrison commander of Quantico Marine Corps Base at the time of Manning’s confinement, told a packed courtroom Tuesday that psychiatrists who treated and observed Manning had written multiple reports asserting that he was not a threat to himself. He said, however, that Manning appeared to be emotionally unstable, at times playing peek-a-boo with guards, dancing erratically and licking the bars of his cell.

Coombs argued that Manning was courteous and respectful to guards in the brig and had not been disciplined while in detention. He said guards had wrongly interpreted a joke Manning had made about using his clothes to take his own life, saying “The waistband of the underwear can do this, or my flip flops.”

When asked why Manning was not removed from the unit, Choike insisted that given the seriousness of the charges and Manning’s emotional history — he had been put on suicide watch while held in Kuwait before transfer to Quantico — his confinement was appropriate.

Manning has since been moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kan.

In February, an Army general ordered a court-martial for Manning after a preliminary hearing in which the prosecution presented evidence that Manning had given WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of State Department cables, daily field reports from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other classified material.                                                                           0279542-eabe1378f10611fc7df79e98798ba4a1.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003051 00000000000 015216  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        A new Research 2000 poll sponsored by the PCCC shows that the public option is dramatically more popular than Blanche Lincoln. When asked:

QUESTION: Would you favor or oppose the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan — something like the Medicare coverage that people 65 and older get — that would compete with private health insurance plans? (Wording of NYT poll)

A solid majority (56%) of the people of Arkansas said they favored this proposal while only 37% said they were opposed. The interesting thing is this question is asking about a theoretical public option substantially to the left of the public option actually proposed in either the House or the Senate. In both cases, the public option is much more conservative, because it would not be offered to “everyone.” It would only be for the small segment of the population which has had the most trouble getting affordable health insurance (uninsured, self-employed, and small business).

Unlike the public option, Blanche Lincoln’s favorability numbers are terrible in Arkansas. Only 41% of have a favorable view of her, while 49% view her unfavorably. This would probably explain why Arkansas Democrats would, for the most part, be less inclined to support her if she continued her opposition to the public option.Voting against a strong public option would make 46% of Democrats less likely to vote for Lincoln in a primary and only 11% Democrats more likely to back her in a primary. (Note: Lincoln has already twice voted against the public option in committee.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0279546-7d982751f5b4d872abb0b15506fd0392.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003213 00000000000 014763  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        President Barack Obama ridiculed Republicans — particularly Christians — who said they forgave Donald Trump after a 2005 video was leaked featuring him making lewd comments about women.

“I hear people saying, ‘I’m a Christian and so I’m all about forgiveness because nobody’s perfect,’” Obama said, adding that he himself was a Christian who believed in redemption for people who made mistakes.

“If someone does something terrible … I can forgive ‘em, I suppose, if they’re sincere about it, but I don’t want them necessarily leading the country,” he said.

Obama said that it was impossible for both Christians and Republicans to continue to denounce Trump’s comments but to still support him for president.

“You can’t have it both ways here,” he said. “You can’t repeatedly denounce what is said by someone and then say, ‘But I’m still going to endorse them to be the most powerful person in the planet and to put them in charge.'”

He ridiculed Republicans for suddenly running away from Trump after standing by him despite offensive comments.

“We saw this coming, he’s been saying really bad things for a while now. What did you think? He’s just going to transform himself?” Obama asked. “I mean, I’m 55, I know it’s hard for me to change, I know at 70 it’s going to be harder.”

Obama said that Trump’s comments about women were unacceptable, adding that someone who acted like that couldn’t get hired at a 7/11, let alone become president of the United States.

“You don’t have to be a husband or father to say, ‘That’s not right.’ You just have to be a decent human being,” he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279575-2b361519133d27a1314d273378c55971.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006273 00000000000 014410  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The presence of cells or tissues from two individuals, chimeras, or the presence of cells and tissues that include the gonads, tetragametic chimerism can be detected by the analysis of cytogenetics and analysis of polymorphic genetic markers, using patterns of pedigree inheritance. These methodologies include determination of sex chromosomes, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) polymorphisms and panels of short tandem repeats (STRs) that include mitochondrial DNA markers. Studies routinely involve cases of temporal chimerism in blood transfusion, or following allotransplantation to measure the outcome of the organ, lymphopoietic tissues or bone marrow grafts. Demonstration of persistent chimerism is usually discovered in cases of inter-sexuality due to fusion of fraternal twins or in cases of fusion of embryos with demonstrable allogeneic monoclonality of blood which, excluded maternity or paternity when blood alone is used as the source of DNA. In single pregnancies it is possible to produce two kinds of microchimerism: feto-maternal and materno-fetal, but in cases of fraternal twin pregnancies it is possible to identify three different kinds which are related to cases of vanishing twins that can be identified during pregnancy by imaging procedures; (1) hematopoietic, (2) gonadal, and (3) freemartins when the twins have different sex and the individual born is a female with either gonadal or both gonadal and hematopoietic tissues. Fraternal twin pregnancies can also produce fusion of embryos. Such cases could be of different sex presenting with inter-sexuality or in same sex twins. One of such cases, the best studied, showed evidence of chimerism and tetragametism. In this regard, the case was studied because of disputed maternity of two of her three children. All tissues studied, except for the blood, demonstrated four genetic components but only two in her blood of four possible showed allogeneic monoclonality consistent with the interpretation that her blood originated from one hematopoietic stem cell. Also, microchimerism, due to traffic of cells via materno-fetal or feto-maternal has been prompted by reports of their potential association with the development of autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis, and in allotransplantation. In addition, their relevance of chimerism in the positive and negative selection of T cells in the thymus has not been addressed. T lymphocytes play a central role in controlling the acquired immune response and furthermore serve as crucial effector cells through antigen specific cytotoxic activity and the production of soluble mediators. Central tolerance is established by the repertoire selection of immature T lymphocytes in the thymus, avoiding the generation of autoreactive T cells. Expression of chimeric antigens in the thymus could modify the generation of specific T cell clones in chimeric subjects and these mechanisms could be important in the induction of central tolerance against foreign antigens important in allo-transplantation. In this review, we discuss the genetics of chimerism and tetragametism and its potential role in thymic selection and the relevance in allotransplantation and autoimmune disorders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279623-680319517f0eedd0af9a92eb855a0a71.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012377 00000000000 015130  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Imagine for a moment that you are opening the batting in a one-day international. You step out on to the field, assailed suddenly by the reality of what you are about to do: the heat, the light, the noise, the scale of the field and of the crowd. Your partner takes strike, and gets a single away immediately. Not much chance for you to have a look. What's this wicket like, then, low? Slow? How long is it since you've faced this guy with a white ball – two years? Three? But hang on – the umpire's signalling a no-ball. Your first delivery will be a free hit. All of a sudden, you loosen up, feel a little better. You set yourself deep in the crease, get outside leg-stump and free your arms and the ball sails up and over third man. Four. Easy. Thanks. Out with the bad thoughts. In with the good …

Now consider the difference between yourself and Virender Sehwag, to whom this happened the other day in the first ODI against West Indies. Viru stepped back and carved it over third man too – the difference being that he would have done it anyway, regardless of the no-ball and the free hit, and regardless of the fact it was an ODI and not a Test match or any other type of fixture. Because that is Sehwag, the man who gave the world the irreducible 'see ball, hit ball'.

This blog has long seen Sehwag as an avatar, a vision of the future, an outlier. But perhaps he is something else too; mentor, leader, philosopher king. In the modern age, there have always been attacking opening batsman. Gordon Greenidge, no slouch himself, recalled his partnership with Barry Richards at Hampshire: "It was not unusual for applause to be ringing round the ground for his fifty while I still had single figures." Richards once made 325 in a day at Perth against Dennis Lillee amongst others. Then came Jayasuriya, Slater, Hayden, Gayle, McCullum.

Yet none are Sehwag. Jayasuriya, Hayden and Gayle have Test match triple hundreds but Sehwag has two, and came within seven runs of a third. They are power players, yet Sehwag strikes at 20 runs per hundred balls better than any of them. Only Hayden can really claim to be in his class – the others all average about 10 less – and yet Hayden cannot be called a genius; the adjective effortless does not attach itself easily to his game.

Viru doesn't have Gayle's shoulders or Jayasuriya's forearms or Haydo's pecs. He has none of the nervous intensity of Slater or the cross-eyed desire of Hayden. He doesn't really have the insouciance of Gayle or Barry Richards. He is instead an almost implacable little Buddha, soft-edged, calmly accepting of the fates, whether they swing for him or against.

If there is one player he is most like, it is Lara, in that he can hit unstoppably not just for hours but for days. It is they who have built monolithic scores most regularly. Yet Lara didn't open, and he often gave the first hour or so of his innings to the bowler. That has not been Sehwag's way.

His technique is not revolutionary, just thrillingly heightened. What is different about Sehwag is his mind, the way he sees the game. Essentially, he is free. Where tradition insists that the new ball and fresh bowlers and aggressive fields are threats, he sees wide open spaces, a hard ball that will fly off the bat.

Sehwag said as much to David Warner a couple of years ago, when the notion of Warner wearing the Baggy Green was inducing not only ridicule but indignance. "He said to me, 'you'll be a better Test cricketer than you are a Twenty20 player'," Warner recalled a few days ago. "I looked at him and basically said, 'mate I've not even played a first-class game yet'. But he said, 'all the fielders are around the bat. If the ball's there in your zone, you're still going to hit it. You're going to have ample opportunities to score runs. You've always got to respect the good ball, but you've got to punish the ball you always punish'."

This week, Warner made his Test debut. Sehwag was more right than most of Australia. Warner does not have Sehwag's talent, but he shares his worldview. There will be many more who do in the years to come, and then it will become the new orthodoxy. That is Sehwag's true legacy. He has shared an era with Lara, Tendulkar, Dravid, Ponting, Kallis, yet he is not one of them. As great as they are and have been, they are the old order, more connected to the past than to the future.

And there is something more important here than just a mindshift, than changes in tactics or techniques. The game must always move forwards and renew itself. Essentially it must accelerate to match the speed of the culture in which it exists. Test cricket of the 1950s is as distant now as the rest of that decade, with its housewives and its radio plays and its music hall conservatism. Warner may or may not succeed as a Test match opener – do you want to bet against Viru? – but plenty like him will. At some point or other they will be the norm, and they will be standing on Sehwag's shoulders, the shoulders of a giant. If he is not the best batsman of his time (and he might be), he is the most significant; a genius and a visionary with it.

Changing the multiplier on AMD’s Duron and T-Bird requires two things:

A motherboard that allows multiplier changes; A CPU with the L1 bridges connected.

Some CPUs leave the factory with all the bridges connected, so you don’t have to do it yourself. As of this date, only the very early AMD CPUs and some of the higher speed T-Birds leave the factory with connected bridges. In most instances, you will have to connect them yourself.

The First pic shows where the bridges are located on the CPU. It’s in the same location for Durons and T-Birds.

Looking closer at this section of the CPU, you will see that these bridges are very small. The cut is even smaller; it’s done with a laser and is just wide enough to break the connection. Your task is to reconnect the two legs.

Here’s an idea of size. In this composite shot, the top pic is a regular #2 pencil next to the L1 bridges. Do not use a mechanical pencil – many of the leads used contain plastic fillers that make them insulators, not conductors. Using a pencil is one option – we’ll discuss some others later. Now, sharpen the pencil to the finest point you can and VERY CAREFULLY connect the first bridge – it should now look like the middle pic.

Do the same to all four and is should look like the bottom pic. ABSOLUTELY make sure that each bridge is separate from its closest neighbor. If you inadvertently connect two bridges to each other, you could blow the CPU.

Once you’ve connected up the bridges, place the CPU into the motherboard’s socket and try to change the multiplier. You’ll know right away whether or not the bridges are connected.

OTHER CONNECTING METHODS

Pencil is the cheapest, easiest and quickest way to connect the L1 bridges. Some have reported that the connection “wears out” over time and the bridges have to be re-penciled. The more permanent methods use conductive paint or a “Conductive Pen”; both of these methods are permanent but erasable with solvent – if you make a mistake, wipe it off with solvent and start over.

What’s pictured above are bridges connected with “Rear Window Defogger Repair Kit” paint. If you look at the grids on a car’s rear window, you will see thin brown lines painted on the glass. This repair kit contains conductive paint so that if one of the bridges is cut, you can reconnect it with this paint. It should be available in any auto parts store.

Don’t even try to use the brush they give you with the kit. I have found the best tool to apply the paint is the tip of a pin. Dip the tip into the paint, just putting on a small dab of paint, and connect a bridge. The paint usually dries very quickly, so you can’t linger too much. You can use nail polish remover as the solvent to wipe off any mistakes.

You can also get a Connective Pen that’s used to connect electronic circuits (e.g, Chemtronics CW2200MTP). It is used by electronic technicians to repair broken traces and is a silver based paint, much like the defogger paint. It looks like a pen and the tip is supposed to allow you to connect fine lines, but I still use a pin.

Michael Holaday sent me an email with another technique:

“I have what I think is a pretty slick technique of unlocking AMD’s bridges. I use the rear window defroster repair paint (keep reading, here’s the cool part). Just lay down one big thick blob covering all 8 pins; then scratch 3 lines through the blob like this – :|:|:|:. You now have 4 little blobs – the 4 bridges – that’s it – done! It seems to me this method requires much less time, effort, and dexterity than fashioning 4 very fine lines.”

And Simon Tan had this idea:

“Get 4 small strands of wire either from a speaker cable or whatever cable you can find that is stranded. Lay them over the traces and place a piece of scotch tape over it. Now you got yourself a very crude piece of trace tape that cost next to nothing.”

I’m sure there are more ideas floating around, so this is just a sample.

Verstappen is currently committed to Red Bull for 2018 but there are understood to be some options that could allow him to leave as early as 2019.

A chat between his father Jos and Wolff at Mercedes on Friday at Monza fuelled speculation about a potential future deal, but the Mercedes boss insists the chat was just a social one.

“I’ve known Jos for many years,” Wolff told Sky Germany about the meeting. “We have a common friend, Frank. He is on a visit here. So Niki [Lauda] and I sat in the office. Our Dutch friends came along and we had a coffee with them. Not more, not less.”

Asked whether there was any interest in Verstappen as a Mercedes driver in the future, Wolff said: “For next year, no interest in Max Verstappen. He is not available.”

However, well aware about the question marks regarding 2019, Wolff said that Mercedes was keeping an eye on a host of youngsters.

“He is one of the names you have to have on the radar,” he said. “Max is one of the future stars of Formula 1.

"Like many others, like Valtteri [Bottas], like Daniel [Ricciardo]. Max and Esteban Ocon are part of this group of drivers as well.”

Mercedes will keep Valtteri Bottas for 2018 after a strong first campaign for the team, but there remain questions about how long a deal he will get.

Wolff added: “It's all about the details. It's a no-brainer to continue with Valtteri. He has done a really good job this year.

"He's had his lows as well, which he needs to understand. But we couldn't expect more from his first year.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0279538-d257aa4d3fd46ade0755389bd0dda09c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001335 00000000000 015343  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        I’m in a really good mood right now because I just found a fix for a bug that’s been driving me up the wall for a long time. I’ve been using Dreamweaver for quite a while now, but just in the past few months I’ve noticed an issue where everytime I closed and reopenned the program it forgot the username and password for every single FTP account I had saved. I knew this problem hadn’t been around forever as I have used this version for a long time before it started happening. After finally taking the time to do some research on the matter I discovered that the issue was caused by installing IE7 (or IE8). Somehow that process induced a bug in Dreamweaver and it could be solved simply by updating to 8.0.2. Fancy that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279087-b739573add08624985e542787aae9a52.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003227 00000000000 014734  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Portland Timbers forward Fanendo Adi was back at it again Saturday night scoring two goals in the home side's 3-1 win over the San Jose Earthquakes. The brace was Adi's 11th of his career--a Timbers record--and it is also the third time he has come off the bench to record a multi-goal output.

But he had help. Forward Lucas Melano was speeding down the right channel in the 9th minute of second-half stoppage time with the goal in his sights before unselfishly squaring the ball to a wide open Adi to tap in.

The duo's performance earned Adi a place on the MLS Team of the Week with Melano snagging an honorary mention bench spot.

Excluding propellants or special effects, the points of light ejected from fireworks, termed 'stars', generally require an oxygen-producer, fuel, binder (to keep everything where it needs to be), and color producer. There are two main mechanisms of color production in fireworks, incandescence, and luminescence.

Incandescence

Incandescence is light produced from heat. Heat causes a substance to become hot and glow, initially emitting infrared, then red, orange, yellow, and white light as it becomes increasingly hotter. When the temperature of a firework is controlled, the glow of components, such as charcoal, can be manipulated to be the desired color (temperature) at the proper time. Metals, such as aluminum, magnesium, and titanium, burn very brightly and are useful for increasing the temperature of the firework.

Luminescence

Luminescence is light produced using energy sources other than heat. Sometimes luminescence is called 'cold light' because it can occur at room temperature and cooler temperatures. To produce luminescence, energy is absorbed by an electron of an atom or molecule, causing it to become excited, but unstable. The energy is supplied by the heat of the burning firework. When the electron returns to a lower energy state the energy is released in the form of a photon (light).

The energy of the photon determines its wavelength or color.​

In some cases, the salts needed to produce the desired color are unstable. Barium chloride (green) is unstable at room temperatures, so barium must be combined with a more stable compound (e.g., chlorinated rubber). In this case, the chlorine is released in the heat of the burning of the pyrotechnic composition, to then form barium chloride and produce the green color.

Copper chloride (blue), on the other hand, is unstable at high temperatures, so the firework cannot get too hot, yet must be bright enough to be seen.

Quality of Firework Ingredients

Pure colors require pure ingredients. Even trace amounts of sodium impurities (yellow-orange) are sufficient to overpower or alter other colors. A careful formulation is required so that too much smoke or residue doesn't mask the color. With fireworks, as with other things, cost often relates to quality. The skill of the manufacturer and date the firework was produced greatly affect the final display (or lack thereof).

Sequence of Events

Just packing colorant chemicals into an explosive charge would produce an unsatisfying firework! There's a sequence of events leading to a beautiful, colorful display. Lighting the fuse ignites the lift charge, which propels the firework into the sky. The lift charge can be black powder or one of the modern propellants. This charge burns in a confined space, pushing itself upward as hot gas is forced through a narrow opening.

The fuse continues to burn on a time delay to reach the interior of the shell. The shell is packed with stars that contain packets of metal salts and combustible material. When the fuse reaches the star, the firework is high above the crowd. The star blows apart, forming glowing colors through a combination of incandescent heat and emission luminescence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              0279639-ae125c2a93fbb1368b6c3d073a320dc4.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001547 00000000000 015166  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s foreign intelligence agency (BND) plans to spend 100 million euros expanding its monitoring of the Internet, the weekly Der Spiegel reported on Sunday, saying the money would go on staff and technology.

The report came two days before U.S. President Barack Obama was due to visit Berlin, where he was likely to face tough questions about U.S. spying methods.

Many Germans from the former communist east still recall the blanket surveillance carried out by the Stasi secret police, and when news of Washington’s covert electronic spying program PRISM broke last week, it caused outrage.

The BND was unavailable for comment.

Some German politicians criticized the plan, with Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger saying the answer to citizens’ concerns about U.S. spying could not be “Let the Germans do it instead”.                                                                                                                                                         0279614-5c3fca9dc66ca168330617aaeed6dd6e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005746 00000000000 015434  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        This canyon is the deepest canyon to be so narrow (at one point it is only 1,300 feet wide) on our entire continent. Because it is so inconceivably narrow, the tiny green ribbon of the Gunnison River appears to be nothing more than a trickling rivulet when it is actually forty feet wide. What appears to be foaming rapids are actually waterfalls over thirty feet high. What appears to be a stony river bed is actually strewn boulders the size of box cars. The human eye becomes totally inadequate in reporting to the brain what it perceives. If one goes to every lookout along the winding road for ten miles, I will guarantee him that he will be baffled mentally and physically for the rest of the day.

There are several geological periods responsible for the formation of this enigmatic canyon. The hardest of rocks (gneiss, schist and granite) were formed scores of millions of years ago (the Pre-Cambian Period) by tremendous heat and pressure accounting for their crystalline texture (see image). Later great quantities of sand and mud were deposited to form sandstone and shale over the older rocky surface. Eventually the entire region was uplifted and the ancient Gunnison River carved deeper and deeper (on its way to the Colorado River) into the softer shales and sandstones exposing the hard core of gneiss, granite and schist.

After camping under the stars, Maura and I got up early the next day and walked along the trail out to Devil’s Overlook. The West Elk Mountains glowed pink in the rising sun while the pine and juniper trees strongly scented the morning air. Somehow I could no longer believe that I was in a place called Colorado, especially after ambling along for a half mile or so when we approached the railing to look down into a pale blue abyss echoing the thunder of rapids far below. The scene called to mind Edgar Allan Poe’s description of the “hideous crags” of the stormy Norwegian coast in his story “A Descent into the Maelstrom.”

The overwhelming amount of jagged, pinnacled rock dropping straight off into dizzy depths slowly evolved as the sun climbed in the sky into a chiaroscuro of light and shade in the brilliant morning light. Across the canyon, we could see a winding dirt road that led straight to the canyon’s edge. I couldn’t help but think of the movie “Thelma and Louise.”

We continued trekking onward to the highest point on the south rim–High Point Overlook at 8,400 feet. From here we peered down into the many side gorges that formed tributaries of the canyon. These gorges must have been previously composed of less resistant rock. Down toward the base of the canyon we saw huge pinnacles jutting up out of the dizzy depths below. They were created by millions of years of erosion that eventually isolated big segments of rock here and there. Sturdy Douglas fir trees kept their foothold by growing inside grooves at a precarious tilt. Almost every rock along the rim was covered with green, yellow and orange lichens as though the canyon were not wondrous enough!                          0279554-34787b2ffb7df7cb5b0da92a890fe970.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000176016 00000000000 015315  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Hayley Anne Cropper (née Patterson) is the late wife of Roy Cropper. Born as a male named Harold Patterson in 1966, Hayley started treatment to physically become female when she was in her twenties.

When she met Roy in 1998, a kinship was developed as they were both lonely, introspective people. Although he took Hayley's revelation about her sex badly, Roy pursued her to Amsterdam, where she was having the final part of her treatment, and they returned to Weatherfield together as a proper couple.

Hayley had a difficult time adjusting to life in Coronation Street. She was a fast machinist and got a job at Underworld, though when her secret came out and she faced bigotry in the workplace and elsewhere, she found it difficult to cope with. A non-confrontational but resilient woman, Hayley made many friends through her kind and honest nature.

Hayley and Roy were something of an odd couple; they were not overtly romantic with each other, their bond being an emotional rather than physical one. Owner of Roy's Rolls, Roy was an incessantly honest man, and Hayley was one of the few people who understood him. Proving their doubters wrong, they got married in 1999, and again in 2010, by which time changes in UK law meant that their union could be acknowledged legally.

The Croppers couldn't have children, but they fostered Fiz Brown in 2001, and took in several waifs and strays, most notably Becky Granger. However, some abused their kindly nature. In 2003, Tracy Barlow fooled everyone into thinking she'd slept with Roy, and extorted money from Roy and Hayley in exchange for her baby before revealing that Steve McDonald was the real father of Roy's "daughter" Patience Cropper.

In 2007, Hayley discovered that she had a son, Christian Gatley, fathered before her sex change, and admitted to Roy that she'd lied about being a virgin when they met. Roy was shattered by her dishonesty although they soon made up. In 2013, Hayley battled pancreatic cancer. When the treatment failed, Hayley decided to end her life on her terms, which she did on 20th January 2014, passing away with Roy at her side.

Biography

1966-1997: Becoming Hayley

Hayley was born as Harold Patterson in 1966. As a child, she was lonely due to having no friends or siblings, and felt out of place among the other boys. In particular, she never felt right in her body, especially after puberty which she described as "like sores breaking out".

When Hayley was fourteen, her mother walked out on the family and she was raised by her father thereafter. Hayley had respect for her father but he didn't understand her problems. As a teenager, she became friends with a girl called Cath who was similarly outcast amongst their peers. They stopped seeing each other shortly after Hayley lost her virginity to Cath, and as a result Hayley didn't find out until 2007 that Cath had given birth to Hayley's son Christian Gatley. Another friend of Hayley's from this period was Ruth Audsley, who hid her attraction to “Harold”. When her father had an accident, Hayley became her dad's home carer and what life she had outside the house was reduced to nothing.

Over time, Hayley came to better understand her feelings about her mind and body and she decided to become physically a woman. When she told her father this, he threw all photographs of "Harold" into the fire and refused to allow her to wear woman's clothes in his presence. To prepare her body for surgery, Hayley was given hormones and she began identifying herself as a woman. Some time later, her dad was admitted to a care home, and Hayley went out to work as secretary to manager Curly Watts at Firman's Freezers in Weatherfield.

1998-1999: Hayley comes a Cropper

Because of her sheltered upbringing, Hayley was shy and had trouble making friends. Worse still, her position at Firman's was one of authority, and Hayley was too afraid of her colleagues to discipline them. When an unimpressed Curly told Hayley to stop being so wet, he reduced her to tears in front of another colleague, Alma Baldwin. Feeling sorry for Hayley, Alma offered her the hand of friendship, although she was slightly disturbed when Hayley, having no other friends, latched on to her and started following her around.

In February, Curly and Alma broke the news to Hayley that her father had passed away. On hearing that Hayley didn't have anyone else in her life, Alma and Mike Baldwin held a dinner party with Hayley, Curly, Audrey Roberts and Roy Cropper as guests, but the intention to matchmake Hayley and Curly was obvious and embarrassed the pair. However, Hayley was impressed with Roy, whose stories at the dinner table had bored everyone but her, and they went out for a drink afterwards. In Roy, Hayley had found someone who was similarly set apart from the world around him, and although Roy had trouble expressing his feelings, he greatly enjoyed Hayley's company. After a few more dates, Hayley decided to reveal her secret to him. Over a romantic meal at Roy's cafe, Roy's Rolls, Hayley confessed to him that she had been born a man, and explained to him what had led her to decide to change her body. Though she asked only for his friendship, Roy took the news badly and asked her to leave him alone.

Rejected by Roy, Hayley confided her troubles in Alma, also revealing her sex change to her. Alma took the news better, and urged Roy to make amends. Roy regretted his harshness with Hayley and asked her to be his friend again, which she gratefully accepted, but despite liking her as a person, her sex change still made him uncomfortable and their relationship stalled. In April, Hayley received her father's inheritance and went to Amsterdam for her final operation.

After her operation, Hayley remained in Amsterdam and rented a houseboat, intending to stay for a while. She wrote to Roy letting him know where she was, and was shocked when, a short time later, he visited her out of the blue. Having missed each other, they toured the sights of Amsterdam together, while surreptitiously trying to find out where they stood in each other's affections. Roy was especially closed, but as he left to go back the UK, he gave her an engraved gold watch. Hayley caught up with Roy at the airport and returned to Weatherfield with him.

Hayley knew that her past would always be a part of her; immediately on her arrival in the UK, she was stopped by Immigration as she still held a man's passport. Roy and Hayley decided to start an affair and shared their first kiss at the boating lake on the Red Rec.

Unable to return to Firman's Freezers, Hayley got a job at Underworld knicker factory when Roy won a bet with Mike Baldwin that Hayley could out-machine any of his girls. Hayley was thrilled to work in an environment where she could just be "one of the girls", but her colleagues took some time to warm to her due to her showing them up with her speed on the sewing machine. Additionally, Mike discovered her secret when Alma told him why the DSS was insisting that Hayley was called Harold. Worried about staff morale should the girls find out, Mike sacked Hayley, but without knowing the reason behind it, the girls demanded her reinstatement and threatened to strike. Mike eventually caved in and re-hired Hayley.

Looking for somewhere permanent to live, Hayley was delighted when Roy asked her to move in with him, dutifully offering to sleep on the sofa until they were married. His offer came with a proposal of marriage, but Hayley had to decline, reminding him that they couldn't marry under UK law. However, she did not want to sleep apart from Roy anyway, and as she moved into Roy's flat, they cemented their relationship, although Hayley lied to Roy by telling him that, like him, she was a virgin.

At work, Hayley had to live with Mike's constant ribbing. His bad treatment of her intensified when Roy threw a pint over him in the Rovers Return in retaliation for calling Hayley a freak. Eventually Hayley decided she'd had enough and told the girls herself. The news quickly spread throughout Coronation Street, stunning the residents. After the initial surprise, most were supportive of Hayley, but some, such as Les Battersby, picked on her, while at work Linda Sykes tried to make her use the gents toilets, resulting in Mike stepping and forcing Linda to back down (although his intentions were only to get everyone back to work, rather than anything noble). Hayley felt the strain of everyone watching her and contemplated leaving Weatherfield, but Roy pleaded with her to stay and together they braved the Rovers.

At the end of the year, Hayley bought Gail Platt's share of the cafe but went on working at the factory. With Hayley behind him, Roy bought a new unit in Victoria Street, No.16, and the flat above, and moved the cafe there.

In February 1999, Hayley became suspicious of Roy's movements when he put on his best clothes to go for a walk. Following him along with Linda and Janice Battersby, she saw him meeting a woman, who turned out to be Beryl Freeman, his dancing tutor. Unbeknown to Hayley, Roy was planning to propose to her at the upcoming 70s Valentine's dance, but when Roy caught Hayley spying on him even after he'd explained why he was seeing Beryl, he felt betrayed by her lack of trust, causing a brief rift between them. However, with some prompting by Alma, he surprised Hayley by turning up at the disco dressed as John Travolta and showed that his dancing lessons hadn't gone to waste. He then proposed, and Hayley excitedly accepted, agreeing not to be defeated by a law.

Driven by his determination to fulfill his promise to Hayley, Roy found (via Emily Bishop) a minister who agreed to perform a ceremony at St. Paul's Church. Hayley made her own dress, while the train was made by the other girls and presented to her at her hen party at No.5, with Janice Battersby selling Les's records to pay for it. In revenge, Les tipped off a reporter about the wedding between "two blokes". As the day arrived, the wedding party was just about to arrive when the press turned up at the church. While minister Jessica Lundy and Spider Nugent kept the reporters occupied, Emily intercepted the wedding party and told them to turn around. Hayley thought the day ruined but to her great surprise, Roy hastily re-organised the day's events, moving the ceremony to the cafe. With Alma as Matron of Honour, Martin Platt as Best Man, and her Great Uncle Bert as Father of the Bride, Hayley and Roy were married on 23rd April 1999. By law they were still unwed, but with Hayley changing her surname to "Cropper" by deed poll, they considered themselves a married couple.

1999-2002: Fostering and Wayne Hayes

The following year was relatively quiet for the Croppers. As Hayley had yet to update her passport, they took their honeymoon in York. Although not a loving couple in the romantic sense, they were friends as well as husband and wife and enjoyed doing things together, such as taking Spanish lessons and learning first aid.

In March 2000, Hayley attracted the attentions of Stuart Leigh, a builder working on the Medical Centre development. Stuart kept popping into the cafe to see Hayley and they developed an innocent flirtation, with the understanding that nothing would happen due to Hayley being married. However, having got wind of the relationship, Les Battersby told Stuart that Hayley used to be a man. Stuart then confronted Roy and Hayley in the cafe and called them freaks.

The following month, Hayley was promoted to supervisor at the factory, with responsibility for quality control. Hayley was determined to prove herself capable and challenged Gwen Loveday about her shoddy work.

In September, having recently become closer to thirteen-year-old Sarah Platt and become godmother of her daughter Bethany, Hayley's thoughts turned to children and she suggested to Roy that they adopt. Roy suggested fostering instead, as they would be able to help more children, and Hayley agreed. They successfully applied and were taken on as foster parents. However, their first experience with a foster child wasn't an official one - on Christmas Day, they caught Wayne Hayes stealing food from the cafe, having run away from home. He was collected by his stepfather Alex Swinton and eventually returned to the children's home. The Croppers struck up an instant bond with Wayne, but although the quiet lad hadn't said why he ran away from home, as Alex left with Wayne, Roy saw him hit the boy through the cafe window.

In January 2001, the Croppers were accepted as foster parents and received their first foster child: Jackie Mosley, who stayed for two weeks while her mother was in hospital. It being a big step for them, Hayley and Roy were very attentive and enthusiastic, much to Jackie's chagrin, but overall it was a pleasant experience for them. In April, they fostered Fiz Brown, a headstrong and somewhat rebellious young woman. Fiz tried her usual tricks to skive off school, only to be caught in the Corner Shop by Hayley when she was supposed to be ill. After setting the cooker on fire, Fiz was berated by Roy and retaliated by reporting him for hitting her. The Croppers were relieved when they were informed that Fiz had done similarly before, and there would be no action taken. Fiz subsequently returned to the area after turning sixteen, where she enjoyed a far better relationship with the Croppers.

In the summer, Hayley encountered Wayne Hayes and his mother Sheila in the Kabin and brought them to the cafe for lunch. Wayne later returned and stayed the night, feeling safe with the Croppers. Roy and Hayley felt protective of Wayne and, when he confessed that Alex often lashed out at him and his mum, they decided to act and reported Alex to Peter Hartnell, their contact from Social Services. However, when interviewed the Hayes family and Alex denied any abuse was taking place, and the Croppers were suspended from fostering for good measure. Refusing to give up on Wayne, Roy and Hayley implored Sheila to put her story straight, but she was too afraid of Alex even to admit the truth to them. They then tried recording Alex confessing to being abusive, but he spotted the tape recorder and smashed it. Alex then stunned them by offering to sell Wayne to them for £10,000, which he lowered to £5,000, eager for them to accept. Roy paid the money without Hayley's blessing, but although Sheila returned it, she agreed for Wayne to remain with the Croppers for the time being.

While Wayne was staying with them, Roy and Hayley pretended to the neighbours that they were fostering him. For a few weeks, they lived in fear of Alex, Social Services and the police, finding little comfort in the fact that they were doing it to protect Wayne. Eager to give Wayne a sense of normality, they agreed to go on a camping trip with Martin Platt, Sally Webster and their children, but they were tracked down by Alex, who had heard about Hayley's sexuality from Les Battersby. With Alex threatening to call the police, the Croppers stole Martin's car and, taking with Wayne with them, sought refuge with Hayley's old friend Ruth Audsley in Warwickshire. A police search for the couple ensued, with the papers reporting them as kidnappers and painting Alex as a concerned stepfather. In desperation, Hayley and Roy hatched a plan to catch a ferry to Ireland, before coming to their senses and opting to turn themselves in and put their faith in the British justice system. However, before they could do so, Ruth shopped them and they were taken into police custody, and Wayne was returned to his parents.

After explaining the situation fully to the police, the Croppers were granted bail on the condition that they didn't have any contact with Wayne. Furious that the police weren't investigating Alex, Hayley refused to accept her bail condition and was remanded in custody. Roy admired his wife's courage but advised her to change her mind as Wayne would understand them not visiting him under the circumstances. Hayley had a difficult time in prison, as the women in her block knew she was a transsexual and picked on her, but after a few weeks Sheila reported Alex to the police for beating her and Hayley was released, the charges against her and Roy dropped and Alex arrested.

In the wake of the Wayne incident, Peter Hartnell told the Croppers that their fostering suspension would be lifted, but the couple never fostered again.

2003-2004: War with Tracy Barlow

In July 2003, Hayley went to visit her ill Aunty Monica. Just before she left, Hayley got into an argument with Tracy Barlow, standing her ground when Tracy made fun of her sexuality, although it revealed an insecurity in her that Roy didn't find her physically attractive. Unbeknown to the Croppers, Tracy made a bet with Bev Unwin that she could bed Roy, in order to prove that she could have any man she wanted. Hayley then went to visit her family, and when she returned she was stunned when Roy told her he'd had sex with Tracy.

According to Roy, he had got drunk at Peter and Shelley Barlow's wedding reception and woke up the next morning in bed with Tracy. He couldn't remember what had happened in between but Tracy was more than happy to fill in the blanks. While Roy was in a vulnerable state due to his grief over betraying Hayley, Hayley acted out in other ways, initially accusing Tracy of making the whole thing up, and then, after persuading Roy to fight for their marriage and not move out as he proposed, adopting a more feminine image, which was not to either of their liking. They seemed to be back on the road to normality when Tracy dropped a bombshell – she was pregnant, and Roy was the father.

Following Tracy's news, Hayley found it to hard to go on and decided to leave Roy and live in Amsterdam, his betrayal hurting all the more for the fact that it had given him the one thing she couldn't.However, when she caught Roy attempting suicide in the cafe flat, Hayley broke into the cafe and stopped him, forcing him to drink salt water and make himself sick. Her resolve changed, and Hayley decided to support Roy in stopping Tracy from going through with her plan to have the baby aborted. Tracy agreed to have the baby and give it to Roy and Hayley in exchange for £20,000, with £5,000 as a deposit and the rest when the baby was born. The Croppers did not hesitate to pay up, although when Tracy went to the Caribbean with the money, they realised that she could afford to pay for an abortion in a private clinic and sought legal advice from Maya Sharma to find out how they stood. Maya suggested that Roy marry Tracy.

Tired of appeasing Tracy, the Croppers became more aggressive in their dealings with her by telling Ken and Deirdre about her pregnancy, but Tracy hit back by getting an extra £10,000 out of them in exchange for her marrying Roy and then shaming them in public by telling the neighbours about their financial arrangement. A small Registry Office ceremony was arranged with Roy signing his assets over to Hayley beforehand in case Tracy tried to get hold of the cafe in the divorce. A baby girl was born on 9th February 2004, with Tracy stalling the Croppers for a few days before handing the baby over. All the pain they had gone through was forgotten as Hayley and Roy began a new life with their daughter, whom they named Patience Cropper.

A week after the birth, Hayley was serving as a bridesmaid to Karen McDonald at her and Steve's second wedding. In the middle of the ceremony, Tracy arrived and caused a scene by shouting for Roy, resulting in Steve having her ejected. Tracy then announced to the entire congregation that her baby was in fact Steve's, and she never had sex with Roy at all. The Croppers fled from the wedding with Patience, but faced immediate pressure from the Barlows to give Tracy back the baby. Initially considering fighting for Patience, the Croppers made a joint decision to give Tracy back her baby, while they faced the fact that the pain and anguish they went through in the last eight months was all for nothing. While Tracy felt no guilt over her treatment of the Croppers, Ken and Deirdre forced her to pay back the money and make the Croppers godparents to Patience, whose name was changed to Amy Barlow. The Croppers even let Tracy off with paying some of the money in exchange for letting them baby-sit Amy, and when Roy's divorce came through in June, the Croppers celebrated their freedom from Tracy with a candlelit dinner.

2005-2007: Waifs and strays

In March 2005, Hayley and Roy took in ten-year-old Chesney Brown when Les and Cilla went on an extended holiday in Spain without him. Chesney thought the Croppers would be a soft touch and laid it on with stories about how neglected he was at home. They saw through his scheme but even their regular attentive method of parenting were beyond what Chesney was used to at home. A year later, they let homeless Craig Harris move into the flat after finding him living in squalor in the empty bakery next door.

Enjoying making a difference to people's lives, Hayley decided to do voluntary work at the church, although restrictions were placed on her due to her being a transsexual and she was only allowed to work with ex-offenders. While teaching a literacy class, Hayley came into contact with Becky Granger, with whom she had previously worked at Underworld. Becky had fled the area earlier that year, after framing Kelly Crabtree for robbing her friends at the factory. Hayley was wary of Becky's attempts to befriend her but, sensing something in her, decided to cut her a break and gave her a job at the cafe. With her troubled past, Becky's aggressive and thieving behaviour was a hard habit to break, but she was spurred on by her loyalty to the Croppers.

In September 2007, Hayley was saddened to learn of her Aunt Monica's death. After the funeral, Hayley's Uncle Bert passed on to Hayley some letters addressed to her which Monica had held onto. The letters, authored by Hayley's old friend Cath, revealed to "Harold" the existence of his son. Hayley felt compelled to track down her son and hired a private detective, who identified her son as Christian Gatley, manager of a record shop.

Steeling herself, Hayley introduced herself to Christian, but for the moment she was too afraid to tell him who she really was. At the same time, she came clean to Roy about her secretive behaviour of late, and her lie to him about being a virgin when they met. Roy found the situation difficult to accept, but agreed to stand by Hayley provided she was honest from now on. Daunted by the prospect of telling Christian the truth, Hayley immediately broke her promise to Roy by telling Christian that she was his aunt and that his dad Harold was dead. Hayley enjoyed talking to Christian about Harold, but while she plucked up the courage to tell him the truth, her lies became more elaborate, much to Roy's disapproval, whose one piece of advice on the matter was that she couldn't build a meaningful relationship on a lie. Meeting with Christian on the pretence of showing him where Harold's ashes were scattered, Hayley finally told Christian that she was Harold. Christian was weirded out by her revelation and punched Hayley when she ran after him, leaving her bleeding on the ground. Feeling Christian would have responded better if she had told him the truth in her own time, Hayley blamed Roy everything and went to stay with Becky, although once she'd calmed down she returned to Roy.

In October, Hayley was offered a place on a six-month volunteer project building a school in Mozambique. She left Weatherfield immediately, with Liam Connor agreeing to keep her job open at the factory.

2008-2012: The return of Mrs. Cropper

Hayley's volunteer work lasted longer than expected; she didn't return to the UK until November 2008. In that time, she'd fallen in love with Mozambique and its people, and in fact no sooner had she returned to Roy's side that she announced her intention to return and continue her work. On hearing from her friend Tilly Eaves, with whom she had shared a tent in Mozambique, that their project leader Olaf was a womaniser, Hayley confessed to Roy that she had a crush on Olaf and he was part of the reason she wanted to return, but, coming to her senses, she opted to remain in Weatherfield and apologised to Roy for her heartless behaviour.

Deciding not to return to the factory, Hayley continued with her volunteer work and helping Roy at the cafe. The Croppers' charity work included organising a Christmas lunch for the homeless at the cafe. In 2009, Hayley was tempted back to the factory when Tony Gordon offered her the position of manager in his absence, although with the return of co-owner Carla Connor, Hayley returned to her old machinist/supervisor role.

In May 2010, Roy suggested to Hayley that they have a civil partnership, to improve their pension benefits. Hayley broached the possibility of having a legal wedding instead, as they had always intended to do once the law changed, but Roy opposed the idea because of the expense and his discomfort at expressing his feelings publicly. The issue hung in the air for a few weeks until, frustrated with Roy's stiffness and insensitivity, Hayley went to stay with the Windasses. The Croppers were reconciled when Roy bought Hayley a salsa dress as a present. Their reunion was cemented when Hayley was taken hostage at the factory by a maniacal Tony Gordon, escaping after her fellow hostage Carla Connor appealed to Tony's better side and persuaded him to let Hayley go. Realising how close he came to losing Hayley, Roy got down on one knee and proposed marriage, and Hayley accepted without hesitation.

With the help of Mary Taylor and her wedding dossier, Hayley set about planning her dream wedding. Fiz and Becky agreed to be bridesmaids, and Mary found the perfect venue: the Shawbrooke Country House Hotel, which had a function room overlooking the East Lancs steam railway. As a surprise for Roy, Hayley arranged for the wedding bus to stop at the train station and for Roy to drive a steam engine to the venue, with the bridal party in the rear carriage. Hayley's hen night, planned by Becky, saw her blindfolded and led to the cafe, which had been transformed into a salsa bar, where Sean Tully had hired a friend to pose as a Latin lothario and salsa dance with Hayley. Initially helpful, Mary had railroaded Hayley into accepting her suggestions but Hayley had been too polite to tell her to back off. Mary realised she wasn't wanted when she didn't receive an invite to the wedding, and in revenge she disconnected the rear carriage, stranding the bridal party. Commandeering a pump wagon, Fiz and Becky got the bride to the hotel in time, and Hayley and Roy were married legally.

In April 2011, Roy's mother Sylvia Goodwin turned up at the cafe demanding an explanation for Roy's no-show at her husband Roger's funeral, in the process meeting Hayley for the first time. As a boy, Roy had found his mother cold and unsympathetic, and as an adult she still instilled fear in him. However, when Hayley discovered that Roger's death had left Sylvia bereft and living in a care home, she persuaded Roy to take her in. Two months after her arrival, Sylvia's attentions turned to grandchildren. When she found Hayley's hormone drugs, Sylvia assumed she was going through the menopause and gave her an aloe vera plant to help her. This drew the attention of Tracy Barlow, who let the cat out of the bag that Hayley was a transsexual. Sylvia was initially appalled but Roy rose to the occasion and made her feel ashamed for her gut reaction.

Sylvia soon settled down and became an indispensable member of the Cropper family. In October 2012, when Mary won tickets to the United States in a competition, she gave them to Roy and Hayley so that they could visit Sylvia, who was temporarily staying with her companion Milton Fanshaw in Palm Springs, California. Hayley remained there longer than Roy, returning on 9th January 2013.

2013-2014: Cancer and death

In May 2013, Sylvia's friend Dorothy passed on a letter for Roy, from his estranged father, St. John Cropper, asking him to get in touch. The letter stirred up some painful childhood memories of abandonment, but with Hayley's encouragement Roy took a trip to Blackburn to meet St. John. At the given address, they were met by Margaret Cropper, St. John's second wife, who informed them that her husband had recently passed away. Suppressing his feelings of grief, Roy slumped into a depression.

The Croppers' problems were forgotten temporarily when the couple discovered that someone had been in the cafe overnight and moved things around, on multiple occasions. Roy became obsessed with catching the prankster, suspecting Beth Tinker, but the mystery was solved when Deirdre Barlow, walking her dog Eccles, found Roy sleepwalking on the Red Rec. Roy didn't believe it until he saw himself sleepwalking on the cafe CCTV footage (which he'd had installed to catch the prankster). Traumatised by the incident, Roy's sleepwalking episodes intensified, and on one occasion the cafe smoke alarm went off when Roy cooked in his sleep. Hayley insisted that he get a full health check, offering to go through one herself to encourage him.

When she got her results, Hayley was informed by the new GP, Dr. Akhtar, that she had abnormal liver functions and was checked into hospital for an ultrasound scan, which revealed a blockage in her bile duct. She was subsequently booked in for a more in-depth CT scan, after which the doctors broke the news to her that she had pancreatic cancer, and her chances of survival were only one in five. Hayley returned to work but, dazed by the news, she broke down in front of the girls, and privately informed Carla of her diagnosis. With Carla's support, Hayley told Roy and Sylvia about the cancer.

In the following weeks, Hayley had two operations, the first to unblock her bile duct and the next to remove the tumour. Hayley continued to work throughout, insisting on giving herself a sense of normality and asking Roy not to mention the word “cancer” in her presence. She also swore those who knew to secrecy, but Roy blurted it out at Audrey Roberts's birthday party at Nick's Bistro after catching her drinking alcohol. Although appreciative of her friends' support, Hayley got fed up with the barrage of sympathy and decided to take up Mary's offer of borrowing her motor home for a holiday with Roy.

On their return, the Croppers discovered that Sylvia had departed the Street to live with her sister. Hayley then had the operation to remove her tumour, giving Roy her wedding ring to look after while she was in the operating theatre. Upon awakening, Hayley looked at the clock and realised that not enough time had elapsed for the operation to have been successful, and it was confirmed by the consultant, Mr Peakman, that the tumour was inoperable as it encased a vital vein. Hayley was given six months, or up to a year with chemotherapy.

Hayley's prognosis was devastating for the Croppers and their close friends, with Roy constantly fussing over her and trying to keep her from tiring herself. However, Hayley refused to be defined by her illness and remained as active as usual. One of the first things she did was to make a bucket list of everything she wanted to do before she died. Spurred on by a nightmare in which she was still Harold and had never met Roy, she decided to try and make amends with Christian. Hayley got in touch with Christian and he turned up at the cafe to see her, having stood her up at their arranged meeting in Bury two days prior due to his uncertainty about seeing her again. In order to know that Christian's feelings were genuine, Hayley didn't tell him about the cancer, and he delighted her by expressing his regret over hitting her six years prior and informing her that she had two grandchildren, Sam and Maisie. However, their meeting ended on a sour note when Christian refused to let Hayley meet his children.

In October, Hayley and Roy joined a cancer support group, where they met a couple, Jane and Jeff Rayner. Jane shocked the couple by making jokes about her pancreatic cancer, but while Roy found her attitude inappropriate, Hayley was inspired and befriended the couple. A short time later, Roy surprised Hayley by changing the habit of a lifetime and being spontaneous by booking a trip to Blackpool. The couple enjoyed the day immensely, with the highlight being a dance in the Tower Ballroom, Roy having learned ballroom dancing especially for the occasion. On their return, Hayley found out that Jane had been taken to a hospice for round-the-clock care. Hayley was alarmed at her friend's rapid deterioration and revealed to a stunned Roy that she wanted to end her own life when the cancer spread, before her morphine dosage was high enough to make her delirious. Roy couldn't believe that Hayley wanted to take herself away from him earlier than her illness dictated and refused to support her. Their row led to Hayley leaving Roy to stay with Fiz and Tyrone Dobbs at 9 Coronation Street, where she had a collapse due to an infection and was taken to hospital. The Croppers reunited, but the incident only made both parties more entrenched in their positions on Hayley's suicide plot. When Jane passed away a short time later, Hayley struggled to cope and became tough on Roy for not supporting her. With Anna Windass's encouragement (after Roy let slip Hayley's plans), Roy lied and told Hayley that he had changed his mind.

As the year came to a close, Hayley started her chemotherapy sessions and began planning her funeral. To her surprise, Christian returned and introduced Hayley to Sam and Maisie, at the same time asking her for £5,000 to clear his debts. Although disappointed in Christian's tactics, Hayley gave him the money and remarked to a disapproving Roy that she had no regrets. After Christmas, Hayley and Roy went to the hospital for the results of another scan, carried out when Hayley complained about feeling pains. The doctor revealed to the couple that the chemotherapy was proving ineffective due to the cancer being more aggressive than expected, and Hayley's life expectancy was revised to mere weeks. Initially seeming to take the news well, Hayley broke down in a panto queue and asked Roy to take her home, where she became hysterical and knocked the Christmas tree over, complaining that her life had meant nothing. Comforted by Roy, she softened and told him that loving him had made her life worthwhile.

Over the following days, Hayley became more frail and lost her appetite. Feeling herself getting weaker, Hayley decided to end her life the next day and saw each of her close friends in turn, telling them how much she appreciated them, even finding the time to tell Tracy Barlow what a horrible person she was. On her last day, Hayley prepared a lethal cocktail, instructing Roy not to touch it, and ironed Roy's best shirt for the funeral. Leading a terrified Roy into the bedroom, Hayley lay on the bed, while Roy played “The Lark Ascending” by Vaughan Williams, a mutual favourite of theirs, before laying down beside her. In their final conversation, Hayley and Roy reminisced about the past, with Hayley telling Roy that she knew what it was to be loved thanks to him, after which she downed the cocktail and passed away in Roy's arms.

Eleven days after her death on 20th January 2014, Hayley Cropper received a humanist funeral with a colourful theme; mourners were under orders to dress brightly and Hayley was cremated in a coffin adorned with differently coloured flower patterns. This was followed by an upbeat music-filled wake in the Rovers. The manner of Hayley's send-off was entirely appropriate for a woman who always looked to the positive; a woman who had lit up people's lives with her boundless enthusiasm and kindness.

Personality

Hayley joined Firman's Freezers after years of looking after her father, and in the midst of a sex change. It was an emotional time for an emotionally vulnerable woman, which was reflected in her somewhat needy and naive manner in her interactions with her co-workers such as Alma Baldwin. With the support of friends, Hayley gained in confidence and her bubbly personality emerged. She was a kind woman who always put others first, at times such that she could be seen as a pushover, as evidenced by doing her colleagues work for them to meet quotas.

Hayley was very non-confrontational, at least when dealing with bigots such as Les Battersby. Once she had her final operation in Amsterdam, Hayley wanted nothing more than to be one of the girls, but when faced with prejudice it was not anger but disappointment Hayley felt, the abuse serving as a reminder that she would never be able to lead a normal life. Her anger was typically directed at her circumstances, rather than her tormentors. However, she made an exception for Tracy Barlow, giving her a slap when Tracy made cracks about her sexuality during a heated argument.

Faithful, loyal and kind, Hayley didn't mind putting herself out to help others in a jam. Her skill on the sewing machine made her the go-to person when a dress needed making or mending for a wedding or christening, with Hayley going as far as to mend Claire Casey's wedding dress late at night on Christmas Eve. In some ways this was a disadvantage; her easygoing nature made her a poor stand-in factory manager after Paul Connor's death, with Carla having to take over to get things back on track.

Traits

Hayley's manner of dress was indicative of a woman older than her years. She usually wore a shirt and cardigan with a skirt, short hair, and for all of her sixteen years in the Street, she wore the same red anorak. Occasionally, Hayley experimented with a more youthful, feminine look, before deciding that it didn't suit her.

Relationships

Alma Baldwin

Alma Baldwin was Hayley's first close friend following her sex change. Taking pity on Hayley when Curly Watts picked on her for being too unassertive in her job at Firman's Freezers, Alma befriended her in order to boost her confidence. Hayley was so glad to have a friend that she started following Alma around and bought her an expensive sweater. Realising that Hayley had no other friends, Alma searched for a way to free herself of her without hurting her feelings, succeeding when Hayley was introduced to Roy Cropper at dinner at Alma and Mike's flat.

During Hayley and Roy's relationship, it often fell to Alma to talk sense into them during difficult moments, the most significant one being Roy's rejection of Hayley when she confessed her sexuality to him. In 1999, Alma was Matron of Honour at their wedding.

Hayley was also loyal to Alma. When she saw Mike kissing Linda Sykes, Hayley didn't tell Alma to avoid hurting her, but when Alma found out that Mike had a girlfriend, she came clean.

Roy Cropper

Before meeting Hayley, Roy Cropper led a life very similar to his future wife; he was an only child, whose father St. John Cropper had walked out on the family, and his mother Sylvia found him a disappointment due to his oddness. in Coronation Street, he was generally seen as an anorak and a misfit. His relationship with Hayley started out platonically, meeting for the first time over dinner at Alma's flat. With nobody else in the mood for talking, Roy bored the rest of the table with his dry stories, but he had a captive audience in Hayley, and took her out for a drink afterwards.

Roy and Hayley shared a caring, trusting relationship, successful partly because they were friends as well as husband and wife. In most aspects of their lives, they were a team, for example in their volunteer work and becoming first aiders. Hayley was the more open emotionally of the two, with Roy wearing a constant stone face. He had a very analytical, literal mind, and abhorred lying. One instance where this was a problem was when the Croppers were interviewed to assess their suitability as foster parents in December 2000. Roy upset Hayley with his honest but blunt responses to the questions, in which he admitted that he didn't see her as a normal woman, because he knew intellectually that she was a born a man. She briefly left him and went to stay with Alma, before deciding to forgive him. However, Hayley's insecurity over how Roy saw her occasionally cropped up, in particular her fear that he didn't find her attractive, but it was never mentioned again after his near-suicide in 2003 when he thought he'd been unfaithful to Hayley with Tracy Barlow.

Although devoted to Hayley, Roy could sometimes be insensitive. In 2012, he failed to take an interest in Hayley's ballroom dancing due to being caught up in his chess games with Mary Taylor. In 2006, he ignored Hayley in favour of his friend Clifford Ford, who loved trains almost as much as Roy did. Also, his presents to her was usually more suited to him, for example an authentic but rustic meal from the Civil War period (2002), a holiday in Burnham Thorpe for the two hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar (2005), and Scrabble in a foreign language (2003). However, this was borne out of a desire to share his interests with his wife rather than selfishness, and Roy was also capable of more romantic gestures, with the occasional prompting from friends.

When Hayley decided to end her own life when diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer, Roy refused to support her, seeing it as selfish on her part to take herself away from him, cherishing every possible second he could spend with her. For Hayley's sake, he gave his approval, but he let his true feelings slip on occasion. Hayley made him promise to go on and be her eyes, ears and heart for years to come. She passed away with Roy at her side, but she left behind a husband who felt betrayed and abandoned, who was now without his soulmate.

Fiz Brown

Fiz Brown was the second of the Croppers' foster children in 2001. New to the Street, Fiz found Roy and Hayley old-fashioned and caused trouble by reporting Roy for hitting her when they tried to crack down on her skiving off school. A few months later, Fiz returned to the area, older and wiser, and apologised to the Croppers for being rotten to them.

Roy and Hayley's role in Fiz's life was as surrogate parents although in contrast to Becky Granger, Fiz rarely leaned on the Croppers for emotional support and her job alongside Hayley in the factory meant that they were as much friends as mother and daughter figures. In 2009, the Croppers employed Fiz's husband John Stape at the cafe, despite his kidnap of Rosie Webster which had resulted in his imprisonment. In 2011, when Fiz was on remand for murders which John had committed, she asked the Croppers to look after her daughter Hope until she was transferred to the Mother and Baby unit in prison. Hayley was run off her feet looking after Hope but was sad when the time came to give her up.

Angela Harris

Angela Harris was one of Hayley's colleagues from the factory. When her family moved to Coronation Street in 2002, they were known as the “Nelsons” due to be in the witness protection programme. Hayley was the first Street resident to find out their secret, learning the truth when Angela confided in her after Hayley took her to casualty when Angela hurt her finger on the sewing machine. Hayley agreed to keep her secret and didn't even tell Roy.

Hayley also played a part in the drama surrounding Tommy Harris's murder. Interrupting Angela typing the words “you're next” on the factory computer, Hayley was asked by Angela to go to Sheffield and post a letter containing the threat. Angela claimed to be doing it so that the police would take the threat from the Morgan brothers - the cause of their relocation to Weatherfield – seriously. Hayley did so, but was very troubled in deciding to get involved, and told the police about the fake letter when Angela was arrested for her husband's murder. Angela apologised to Hayley and asked her to tell everyone the truth. The murderer was later revealed to be Katy Harris, with Angela taking the blame to protect her daughter.

Becky Granger

Becky Granger entered Hayley's life when Becky started working at Underworld in 2006. One step away from living rough and always in some sort of trouble with the police, about the only thing Becky had going for her was her 'friendship' with Kelly Crabtree, who she betrayed by letting her take the blame for thefts at the factory. Hayley was therefore sceptical when Becky tried to befriend her when Hayley was doing voluntary work with ex-offenders later in the year, but she decided to give Becky a chance, feeling that everyone could be rehabilitated.

Becky's stay with the Croppers reached an impasse when Becky went for a joyride in Hayley's car with her friend Slug, and she was subsequently sacked for starting a fire in the cafe which was actually caused by an electrical fault. Hayley gave Becky her job back at the cafe and from then on there was more trust in their relationship.

Becky grew very attached to “Royston” and “Hayles”. She admired their honesty and loyalty, seeing it as something to aspire to, and her desire to be worthy of their trust was a big motivator in her turning her life around. In an eventful six years in the Street, Becky loved and lost, achieving some of her dreams but constantly arriving back at square one, partly because she always thought that any happiness in her life was temporary and sooner or later she'd blow it. The Croppers usually played a supportive role in her dramas, even those which were of her own making; in 2011, they convinced Dev and Sunita Alahan not to press charges against her for robbing the Corner Shop. In 2010, Becky confided in them her mother's death, which she had kept even from Steve McDonald. Later that year, they supported her when she had her miscarriages, and it was on Hayley's advice that the McDonalds turned to adoption.

Hayley and Becky did have the occasional cross word. In 2007, she assaulted Christian Gatley due to his violent reaction to Hayley's revelation about being his father, causing Christian to flee the area and lose touch with Hayley. In December 2011, when Tracy Barlow had a miscarriage which she claimed was caused by Becky pushing her down the stairs, Becky defiantly refused to take the blame, claiming that Tracy had lost the babies before the stairs incident and slipped down her staircase of her own accord. Due to her longstanding feud with Tracy, Becky was shunned by the residents, with only Roy and her sister Kylie Platt believing her. When Becky heard Hayley admitting to Roy that she didn't know who to believe, she became angry and shoved her. Hayley regretted her harsh words and she and Becky soon made up. The Croppers were one of the few people Becky said goodbye to when she left the Street a few weeks later, to start a new life in Barbados.

Carla Connor

Carla Connor became the Underworld co-manager in 2007 following the death of her husband Paul. Carla appreciated Hayley as a valuable member of the sewing room team, but nothing more; poles apart in personality, Carla was a glamorous factory boss, and Hayley a frumpy staff supervisor. It wasn't until 2009 that Hayley took on a greater significance in her life; when Carla's husband Tony Gordon made a deathbed confession to arranging the murder of Liam Connor to Roy, only to recover, Roy became obsessed with exposing him. This culminated in Tony nearly drowning Roy in the canal before turning himself over to the police and confessing to his crimes. Carla was absent from Weatherfield throughout these events, as she had fled to California when Tony admitted the truth to her months earlier. Upon her return, she faced the disgust of the residents, Hayley among them, although Hayley was one of the first to forgive Carla.

In June 2010, Tony escaped from prison and took Carla and Hayley hostage at the factory, intending to kill Hayley along with Carla so that Roy would feel the same loss he felt when Maria Connor turned her back on him. He only set Hayley free when Carla pleaded with him, and the incident ended with Tony perishing in a blaze he started himself. Hayley credited Carla for being the reason she was still alive, and the two became close, if unlikely, friends. In September 2011, Hayley cleared Frank Foster's things from the factory after his rape of Carla and ran the factory in her absence.

In 2013, Carla was one of the first people to find out about Hayley's cancer treatment. Then awaiting the results of her CT scan, Hayley couldn't concentrate at the factory and explained her situation to Carla. Carla drove her to the hospital, where she found out she had pancreatic cancer. After Roy, Carla provided the most support to Hayley in her final months, and in fact often acted as a counterbalance to Roy by encouraging Hayley to stay active and trying to boost her spirits, which was much appreciated by her ailing friend. During their last conversation, Hayley thanked Carla for giving her three extra years of life. Finding her manner odd, Carla investigated and persuaded Anna Windass to let her into the flat, where they found Roy with a lifeless Hayley, who had passed away moments before. When she saw Anna wash a glass from the bedroom, Carla realised that Hayley had taken her own life before the cancer reached its final stage, but she respected Hayley's choice not to share her plans with her and didn't pursue the matter further.

Hobbies and interests

Hayley and Roy shared many interests and activities. In 1998, they took evening classes in Spanish, which led to hilarity when, on their way to their way to their inaugural lesson, they stumbled into a “life class” with a nude Nick Tilsley as the model. They later joined the Amateur Operatics together, with Hayley encouraging a terrified Roy to try for The Sound of Music with her. Both were successful in their auditions.

The following year, the Croppers joined the Weatherfield First Aiders. Taking his duties very seriously, Roy upset Hayley by repeatedly critiquing her technique, resulting in her sticking a plaster over his mouth. They went on to possibly save their groupmates' lives by evacuating the first aid tent when a rocket landed on it and started a fire at the local firework display.

Hayley and Roy were also interested in seeing the world. In 2004, Roy bought Hayley an old globe and suggested they travel the world, starting with Kent, although they were tired out by one day's travelling and sold their camper van to Harry Flagg.

In many respects, the Croppers were very different and this was reflected in their other interests. In 2010, Hayley took dance classes with Anna Windass, and two years later learned ballroom dancing with Norris Cole and Mary Taylor. Dancing with Norris in her dancing exam, Hayley passed with flying colours, although much to her annoyance, Roy was more interested in his and Mary's chess games. Hayley's theatrical bent extended to singing, with her singing Abba on stage along Deirdre Rachid, Linda Sykes and Janice Battersby at the Street's Millennium party in 2000.

Hayley had also been a keen bowler since the 1980s, when she competed in the East Lancashire Semi-Pro Guild. Her passion for bowls was passed on by her father. In 2004, she joined the Rovers Ravers, and ended up carrying the team as she was the only one with any experience at the sport. Her return to the fray ended on a sour note as she was disqualified due to her being registered as Harold and therefore not allowed to compete in the all-woman team.

Background information

Creation and casting

The idea of introducing a transgender character came about during a story meeting, when the writing team were discussing the possible introduction of Coronation Street's first homosexual character. However, as other UK soaps such as Brookside and Hollyoaks had recently covered such storylines, the idea did not appeal to the team. Producer Brian Park: “[We] didn't want to be seen as chasing their tails so much. So when we had our transsexual character brought in, we thought that neatly transcended it, but in a slightly Coronation Street way: we went one step further but didn't shake it to its foundations as well... I can't remember whose idea that was. I think maybe Ann McManus came up with it. And I said, 'Brilliant!'” (50 Years of Coronation Street: The (very) Unofficial Story, JR Books, 2010)

Hayley Patterson was devised as a young, shy woman who would fall for Street anorak Roy Cropper. Although it was decided that Hayley would be a pre-op transsexual when viewers first meet her, Park was determined that Hayley would be portrayed with dignity: "We are approaching it sensitively. We'll get to know Hayley as a person, not a soap-box cause." (The Guardian, 17th January 1998) To widen the field of available talent, the decision was taken to have an actress play the part instead of a transgendered woman.

27-year-old Julie Hesmondhalgh was born in Accrington, Lancashire. She trained as an actress in London before returning to Manchester. She was appearing in Much Ado About Nothing at the Royal Exchange Theatre when she was spotted by a member of the casting team and subsequently asked to audition for Coronation Street. Before auditioning, the actress was given sketchy details about the character, with one glaring omission: “All I knew at first was there's a part going in Coronation Street, she's called Hayley, she's going to work in the factory and she's fun. That's all they told me. So I immediately imagined myself as a Bet Lynch-type character and I did literally pitch up for the audition with red lipstick and a leopard-skin coat. Then Judi Hayfield, the casting director, said to me: 'I don't know how to begin to tell you what this part is or how you'll feel about it, but she's a transsexual and at the moment she's still in a male body. What do you think about that?' Well, I was gobsmacked, of course, but I thought it was a fantastic idea. So I went away to this great bookshop in Manchester and said I need every book you've got on transgender.” (Fifty Years of Coronation Street, Headline Publishing Group, 2010) At 27, Hesmondhalgh was four years younger than her character.

Hayley's attire and mannerisms were used to subtly hint at her background. Hesmondhalgh: "I worked with the costume department to create a look. There was the wig, of course, I had to have my shoulders built up in my cardigans and there was the ubiquitous polo neck that was supposed to hide my Adam's apple. And of course we had to plaster on tons of make-up." (Sunday Mirror, 8th March 1998) "The point about transsexuals is that they want to blend in. I keep my chin tucked in and my head down and my hands in front of me or under the table, because she would want to conceal her masculine hands. She is terrified of anything that might give her away." (The Guardian, 17th January 1998) However, she was written and played as a woman from the outset. Brian Park: “We had hoped for her to be a sympathetic character and we didn't want to make her big and blowsy and looking like Pete Burns." (50 Years)

Contemporary reaction

News that Coronation Street was set to introduce British soap's first transsexual character broke in the papers two weeks before Hayley's on-screen debut in Episode 4341 on 26th January 1998. Media outlets, noting the programme's usual reluctance to confront soap taboos, predicted "a storm of outrage, particularly from older viewers" (The Star, 16th February 1998). However, reaction to the character was mainly positive. Granada received three letters of complaint, all which were about Hayley being played by a cis-gendered woman and not a transwoman. Following Hayley's confession to Roy that she was a transsexual on 27th February 1998, the Independent Television Commission received ten complaints that it wasn't suitable for a pre-watershed timeslot. These complaints were rejected, with the ITC commenting that the issue had been handled with "tact and great sensitivity". (The Daily Telegraph, 21st April 1998)

Most criticism came from the LGBT community, who slated the portrayal of Hayley as cliched and ill-informed. For Hayley's return to the programme some months later, a communication was established between the production team, including Julie Hesmondhalgh, and a trans advisor associated with Press for Change, the transgender campaign and information group. This liaison continued for eighteen months.

On the reaction from the LGBT community: "There's no way either me or Granada see this as a funny subject. I know the transsexual community have experienced terrible prejudice because of fear and ignorance, but this storyline has actually got people talking about a subject they might otherwise not have known about. I think the whole thing has been incredibly positive." On being a woman playing the role: "I know a lot of the transsexual community were upset that it was a woman playing the part of Hayley, and not a transsexual. They thought it was a cop-out. But we wanted the character to live and breathe a bit so that people could get to know her without prejudice. We didn't want people to be fearful of her and dislike her for the wrong reasons."

Reaction to the character improved over time, with praise focusing on Hayley's relationship with Roy. Hesmondhalgh: "Since the scene was broadcast when Hayley told Roy I have personally found that people have been very positive. Most just want Roy and Hayley to get together." (Lancashire Evening Telegraph, 7th March 1998)

Partnership with Roy

After her initial two-month stint was deemed a success, Julie Hesmondhalgh was given a new contract and Hayley returned as a permanent character with Episode 4429 on 29th June 1998, beginning with a memorable set of episodes filmed on location in Amsterdam, where Hayley reunited with Roy having completed her transformation into a woman. Julie Hesmondhalgh was pleased to be working alongside David Neilson again, believing that he helped her performance: "It's in the costume and the wig and acting with David, who's so brilliant as Roy. When he transforms himself, it transforms me." (Woman's Own, 15th April 1999)

Hayley's relationship with Roy was especially well-received by viewers, despite the actors' initial fears about putting two oddball characters together. Hesmondhalgh: “I think in the beginning the original idea may have been pitched as a sort of joke – you know, give Roy a girlfriend and she turns out to be a man. But I was really conscious that I didn't want it to be making fun of her, and as it happened it was beautifully written and David [Neilson] and I played it, and continue to play it, as a delicate love story.” (Fifty Years) On their relationship, David Neilson: "Everything just clicked and the two characters just seem to sparkle together," (Inside Soap)

In 1999, the writers decided that Hayley and Roy would marry. At that point, they could not legally marry as under UK law Hayley would be recognised as a man. This was incorporated into scripts, with Curly Watts finding a vicar who would carry out a blessing ceremony which was then treated like a wedding, with Hayley changing her name by deed poll to Hayley Cropper. After the "wedding" was screened, the Labour Government announced that a Parliamentary Working Group was being created to assess how the UK could grant trans people the legal rights for which they had fought for decades. The result of this was the tabling, in 2004, of the Gender Recognition Act, granting trans people full legal status in their acquired sex. It has been said that the character of Hayley Cropper deserves partial credit for bringing the issues faced by trans people to public attention in a sympathetic manner, rather than the sensationalist coverage that had previously existed. As a result of this change in the law, the Croppers had a legal wedding in 2010.

For their on-screen partnership, Julie Hesmondhalgh and David Neilson received a British Soap Award in 1999 and 2004. They went on to be one of the longest-lasting couples in Coronation Street history, something which pleased the actors. Hesmondhalgh: "Because nobody else would have them, the scriptwriters have got to be a bit imaginative with us - they can't just keep splitting us up and sending us off and having affairs and having children and things. They've got to be a bit more imaginative, so it's great - it works out good for us." On the value of the couple: "I've said this before, but they are, despite how unusual they are as people, they are the most conservative couple on the Street really. And you need that. You need a couple of people who just love each other and stay together through thick and thin."

In 2009, David Neilson, Julie Hesmondhalgh and Katherine Kelly starred in direct-to-DVD spin-off Coronation Street: Romanian Holiday, shot on location in Romania.

Storylines

Julie Hesmondhalgh left Coronation Street temporarily in 2001 to give birth to her daughter, Martha Mo. In 2007, she enjoyed playing scenes of Hayley meeting her son Christian Gatley, although his existence went against known Street history which had established Hayley as a virgin. Hesmondhalgh: “I was very excited to be involved in some action drama because that's not my normal place in the show, I'm usually behind a knicker machine or serving butties. When I got the scripts for those episodes I read them like a novel, all five episodes back to back – I found it absolutely thrilling.” (Fifty Years)

Shortly after this storyline was transmitted, Hesmondhalgh took a year off to concentrate on family. She returned in Episode 6950 on 17th November 2008. In 2012, she took three months off to appear in Black Roses: The Killing Of Sophie Lancaster at the Royal Exchange Theatre.

In her sixteen years as Hayley, Hesmondhalgh wore the same red anorak. In 1999, the actress responded to suggestions that it was time to pack away her trusty anorak: "A charity shop sent me a new one the other week. But I think the anorak has got to stay - it's an institution!"

Departure

On 11th January 2013, it was announced that Julie Hesmondhalgh would be leaving Coronation Street at the end of her contract in early 2014. Hesmondhalgh quit the programme to pursue other work, having enjoyed her return to the stage the year before: "The decision to hang up Hayley's red anorak was a tough one. But doing the play at the Royal Exchange last year made me realise that there's life in the old dog yet. Whatever happens next I'll always be proudest of lovely Mrs Cropper."

The decision to kill Hayley off came from incoming producer Stuart Blackburn, who described it as the "easiest decision [he'd made]". Hayley's exit storyline saw her diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer and, in a story twist, decide to end her life on her own terms. Much of the drama in Hayley's final months concerned Roy's refusal to accept her plans. Blackburn: "This is a very sensitive issue and we will be exploring the effects of her decision on husband Roy who has a huge emotional and moral dilemma over her choice to die this way." Hesmondhalgh agreed that killing Hayley off was the only believable option: "In a way, she has to die because it would be much more of a betrayal of everything if she just left Roy. She'd never do it."

As the storyline played out, Hesmondhalgh feared a backlash from fans over the storyline but was surprised by the reaction: "I've had so many messages and it's been overwhelming. I did think that people might be angry about it because a lot of people don't want to be watching Corrie and to be seeing this sort of thing, especially with a character that's likable like Hayley. But a lot of people have said because it's been so true to Roy and Hayley, they've found it moving. For me it's a love story with a beginning, middle, and an end and this is the end."

Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, is in trouble.

Polls show her slightly ahead of socialist Bernie Sanders in Iowa, but narrowly behind in New Hampshire. And the weekend brought new revelations about yet more classified and secret documents sent over her private email server when she was secretary of state.

Between now and November, she will be traversing a minefield, with detonations to be decided upon by FBI investigators who may not cherish Clinton and might like to appear in the history books.

Clinton’s charge about Donald Trump’s alleged “penchant for sexism” brought a counterstrike – her being the “enabler” of Bill Clinton’s long career as a sexual predator – that rendered her mute.

But with Hillary Clinton having raised the subject, it is almost certain to be reintroduced in the fall, if she is the nominee.

Then there is the newly recognized reality that Clinton, who ran a terrific comeback race against Barack Obama in 2008, is not the candidate she was. Nor is Bill the imposing surrogate he once was.

Both are eight years older, and show it. “Low energy” nails it.

Lastly, Hillary Clinton now has a record to defend as secretary of state, a four-year term in which it is hard to see, looking back, a success.

Moreover, a defeat by Sanders in Iowa or New Hampshire could prove unraveling, with the press herd tapping out early obits.

New Hampshire has consequences.

A Granite State defeat by Sen. Estes Kefauver ended Harry Truman’s bid for re-election in 1952. Lyndon Johnson’s narrow write-in victory over Sen. Eugene McCarthy, 49-42, brought Bobby Kennedy into the race – and LBJ’s withdrawal two weeks later.

George H. W. Bush’s unimpressive New Hampshire win in 1992 brought Ross Perot in as a third-party candidate two days later, and Bob Dole’s loss in 1996 portended defeat in the general election.

But if a cloud is forming over the Clinton campaign, the sun continues to shine on The Donald.

Last July, in a column, “Could Trump Win?” this writer argued that if Trump held his then 20 percent share, he would make the final four and almost surely be in the finals in the GOP nomination race.

Now, in every national and state poll save Iowa, Trump runs first with more than 30 percent, sometimes touching 40. And, save in New Hampshire, Sen. Ted Cruz runs second to Trump.

What does the surge for socialist Sanders and the Republican base’s backing of the outsiders Trump and Cruz and collective recoil from the Republican establishment candidates tell us?

“The times they are a changing,” sang Bob Dylan in 1964.

Dylan was right about the social, cultural and moral revolution that would hit with Category 5 force when the boomers arrived on campuses that same year.

A concomitant conservative revolution would dethrone the GOP establishment of Govs. Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and William Scranton in 1964, and nominate Barry Goldwater.

Will the Clintons ever be held accountable? Help make sure they are by supporting the Hillary Clinton Investigative Justice Project, an effort targeting the racketeering enterprise known as the Clinton Family Foundation

Something like that is afoot again. Only, this time, the GOP has a far better shot of capturing the White House than in 1964 or, indeed, than it appeared to have at this point in 1980, The Year of Reagan.

In June 1964, Goldwater, about to be nominated, was 59 points behind LBJ, 77-18, in the Gallup Poll. On Sept. 1, he was still 36 points behind, 65-29. In mid-October, Barry was still 36 points behind, when some of us concluded that Mr. Conservative just might not make it.

Yet, in January and February of 1980, Ronald Reagan, during the Iowa Caucuses and New Hampshire Primary, never got closer than 25 points behind President Jimmy Carter, who led Reagan, on March 1, 58-33. Yet, that November, 1980, Reagan won a 44-state landslide.

Today, according to a new Fox Poll, Trump would beat Clinton by 3 points in the general election, if held now. Another poll shows Trump pulling 20 percent of the Democratic vote.

What this suggests is that nominating Trump is by no means a guarantee of GOP defeat. But beyond politics, what do the successes of Sanders, Trump and Cruz portend?

Well, Sanders and Trump both opposed the war in Iraq that the Bush Republicans and Clinton Democrats supported.

Both Sanders and Trump oppose NAFTA and MFN for China and the free-trade deals that Clinton Democrats and Bush Republicans backed, which have cost us thousands of lost factories, millions of lost jobs and four decades of lost wage increases for Middle America.

Trump has taken the toughest line on the invasion across the U.S.-Mexican border and against Muslim refugees entering unvetted.

Immigration, securing the border, fair trade – Trump’s issues are the issues of 2016.

If a Trump-Clinton race came down to the Keystone State of Pennsylvania, and Trump was for backing our men in blue, gun rights, securing America’s borders, no more NAFTAs and a foreign policy that defends America first, who would you bet on?

Sharapova is joined in the top ranks of women’s tennis by a cavalcade of women from Russia, Serbia, Croatia, and other countries from the former Soviet bloc. “Whatever you may say about women’s professional tennis in the 1970s or ‘80s,” Anne Applebaum wrote in 2008, “it did not feature many players who looked like Maria Sharapova.” Applebaum goes on to share her theory about why there are so many Eastern European tennis players who look like cover girls. The original piece is reprinted below.

Maria Sharapova

There was a particular historical moment, round about 1995 or so, when anyone entering a well-appointed drawing room, dining room, or restaurant in London was sure to encounter a beautiful Russian woman. Though the word beautiful doesn’t really capture the phenomenon. The women I’m remembering were extraordinarily, unbelievably, stunningly gorgeous.

These women were half-Kazakh or half-Tartar with Mongolian ancestors and perfect skin; dressed in the most tasteful, most expensive clothes; shod in soft leather boots; and perfectly coiffed. They were usually accompanied by an older man, sometimes much older, to whom they were perhaps married, or more likely not. They spoke in low, alluringly accented voices and towered over the lesser mortals in the room. I distinctly remember gazing upon one such creature while in the company of a friend, an old Russia hand who’d spent much of the previous decade in the Soviet Union. He stared, shook his head, and whispered, “But where were they all before?”

In the aftermath of the Australian Open, a tennis tournament whose final rounds featured a parade of notably stunning ex-Soviet-bloc players, it is perhaps time to make a stab at answering my friend’s question. Whatever you may say about the Soviet Union in the 1970s and ‘80s, it was not widely known for feminine pulchritude. Whatever you may say about women’s professional tennis in the 1970s or ‘80s, it did not feature many players who looked like Maria Sharapova, the latest Australian Open victor.

Where were they all before?

Though this is a fairly frivolous question (OK, extremely frivolous), I am convinced it has an interesting answer. To put it bluntly, in the Soviet Union there was no market for female beauty. No fashion magazines featured beautiful women, since there weren’t any fashion magazines. No TV series depended upon beautiful women for high ratings, since there weren’t any ratings. There weren’t many men rich enough to seek out beautiful women and marry them, and foreign men couldn’t get the right sort of visa. There were a few film stars, of course, but some of the most famous—I’m thinking of Lyubov Orlova, alleged to be Stalin’s favorite actress—were wholesome and cheerful rather than sultry and stunning. Unusual beauty, like unusual genius, was considered highly suspicious in the Soviet Union and its satellite people’s republics.

This doesn’t mean there weren’t any beautiful women, of course, just that they didn’t have the clothes or cosmetics to enhance their looks, and, far more important, they couldn’t use their faces to launch international careers. Instead of gracing London drawing rooms, they stayed in Minsk, Omsk, or Alma Ata. Instead of couture, they wore cheap polyester. They could become assembly-line forewomen, Communist Party bosses, even local femmes fatales, but not Vogue cover girls. They didn’t even dream of becoming Vogue cover girls, since very few had ever seen an edition of Vogue.

Instructive, in this light, is the career of a real Vogue cover girl, Natalia Vodianova. Born in Nizhny Novgorod to a single, impoverished mother, Vodianova ran away from home at 15 to run a fruit stall in the local street market (successfully, according to her official biography). At 17, she was spotted by a French scouting agent and told to learn English in three months. She did—after which she moved to Paris, married a British aristocrat, and went on to become “the face” of a Calvin Klein perfume and to earn $4 million-plus annually. The fashion world is ludicrously silly and superficial, but it did get Vodianova from Nizhny Novgorod to London, far away from her mother’s abusive boyfriends, which wouldn’t have happened before 1989. Though tennis was, for some, a way out in the past—remember Martina Navratilova—it’s all much easier now: Sharapova and Australian Open semifinalist Jelena Jankovic both left their countries as children to train at a tennis academy in Florida, while losing finalist Ana Ivanovic moved to Switzerland at 15 where she was sponsored by a businessman who is now her manager.

Ultimately, what goes for the fashion world goes for other spheres of human activity. In the past, you had to play chess or be a champion gymnast to come to international attention if you were born in the Eastern bloc—chess and competitive sports figuring among the few party-approved export industries. Nowadays, stars in fields previously unsanctioned by the party—crime novelists, conceptual artists, computer whizzes—from Russia, Hungary, or Uzbekistan have a shot at fame and fortune, too. As for talented entrepreneurs, the sky’s the limit.

Beauty is a matter of luck, but the same could be said of many other talents. And what open markets do for beautiful women they also do for other sorts of genius. So, cheer up next time you see a Siberian blonde dominating male attention at the far end of the table: The same mechanisms that brought her to your dinner party might one day bring you the Ukrainian doctor who cures your cancer or the Polish stockbroker who makes your fortune.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0279625-9fad07a47ec0eaead087504fee98b6e6.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005022 00000000000 015433  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Controlling Software With Your Stare

Posted by Steve Spalding in Featured | View comments

A world of information can be gleaned from a glance. What we look at and how long we choose to look can give meaning and context to all forms of communication. Researchers at Stanford University are using the information locked in a stare to augment and improve the way that people interact with computers.





Eye Point

Modern eye tracking technologies are primarily used to help people who could not otherwise use traditional input devices due to disability as well as in industry to aid in designing more functional technologies. Manu Kumar, a former doctoral student at Stanford (currently an Angel Investor) recognized that with a little work he could modify this eye tracking technology to help able-bodied individuals.

At the core of his research is a software program called EyePoint. It acts as the intermediary between your eyes and a computer. If, for instance, you wanted to click on a link using EyePoint, you would hold down a hot key on your keyboard, look at the link you wanted to click on and then release the key. By combining a keyboard action with gaze-based pointing it makes the interaction much more natural for the user and reduces the number of false positives.

The eye tracking itself is done by using a high-resolution camera and a series of infrared LEDs to capture eye movement. Since eyes aren’t particularly stable, software post-processing is needed to smooth out the jitters.

The application that were tested through the course of Manu’s coursework were pointing and selection, scrolling, task switching and security.

What would be more interesting than gaze being used as an input device would be to use similar information to provide additional context to more traditional applications. Imagine if your computer could know what information you were focusing on and magnify that for easier reading; how about search results that were augmented to take into account the sites that held your attention the longest.

Looking at another angle, eye-tracking studies are already used by advertisers to help them decide how they want to arrange television commercials and print media, imagine if advertisers could extend this to beat banner blindness by dynamically altering placement based on an individuals attention.

While commercial applications of this technology are still over the horizon, this is just another stepping stone in giving computers the ability to understand our intentions more precisely than ever before.

The water levels of the Great Lakes are a greatly talked about subject among many. The Great Lakes are accustom to three major types of water level fluctuation; seasonal, long-term, and short-term. Seasonal fluctuations are generally expressed for one year and consist of the changing four seasons. Long-term levels occur over a certain period of time usually ranging from a few to many consecutive years in time. Seasonal and long-term changes generally show the amount of water in the Great Lakes through the hydrologic cycle. Seasonal and long-term fluctuations of lake levels are mostly talked about among boaters, fishermen, marina owners, plus many others that are associated with the Great Lakes in one way or another. Short-term fluctuations are rarely talked about and range from minutes to hours to days (Gauthier and Manninen,1999; US Army Corps of Engineers and Great Lakes Commission, 1999).

Short-term fluctuations that often occur on the Great Lakes are wind set-up or storm surge, and a phenomenon known as a seiche. A storm surge or wind set-up consists of high sustained winds from one direction that push the water level up at one end of the lake and make the level drop by a corresponding amount at the opposite end.

This is a good illustration of wind set-up. Storm surges increase in height as the wind increases, resulting in surges as high as eight feet on the Great Lakes that are often sudden and unexpected (Clark, 2005; Wittman 2005).

When combined with dramatic changes in atmospheric pressure or a sudden drop in the wind speed, storm surges soon produce a seiche.

A seiche has to occur in an enclosed body of water such as a lake, bay or gulf. A seiche, a French word meaning “to sway back and forth”, is a standing wave that oscillates in a lake as a result of seismic or atmospheric disturbances creating huge fluctuations of water levels in just moments. The standing waves slosh back and forth between shores of the lake basin, often referred as tide-like changes of the Great Lakes, by many. Most seiches on the Great Lakes are results of atmospheric disturbances and a cease in wind, not seismic activity or huge tidal forces ( Heidorn 2004; Wittman 2005).

Many people think there are tides in the Great Lakes and thus result in the huge changes of water levels. True tides are changes in water levels caused by the gravitational forces of the Sun and Moon. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Ocean Service (NOS) have proved that the spring tide, the largest tide on the Great Lakes, is less than 2 inches. The minor tidal changes on the Great Lakes are oblivious compared to the much greater fluctuations of the lakes caused by changes in wind and atmospheric pressure. As a result, the Great Lakes are considered to be a non-tidal water system (NOAA 2005).

The concepts of storm surge and seiche may sound very similar to many people, leaving many confused about what truly happens when. A big difference between storm surge and a seiche on the Great Lakes is the addition of significant changes in atmospheric pressure or quick-moving squall fronts, generating the oscillation of the water.

These two photos of the Muskegon South Lighthouse demonstrate how atmospheric disturbances can change the conditions and lake levels of Lake Michigan. These two photos were taken 6 hours apart on October 21, 2001, the first image showing the normal lake conditions and the second image 6 hours later representing a seiche at Muskegon.

Storm surges are the most common type of short-term fluctuations on the Great Lakes as quite often strong storm winds blow across the lakes and pile up water on the downwind shore of the lake, resulting in wind set-up. On the opposing upwind shore, the storm surge lowers the water the exact amount that has risen at the downwind shore, resulting in a wind set-down.

A seiche is exactly the same as storm surge except the surface water oscillates by sloshing between opposing shores within the lake basin, decreasing in height with each rocking back and forth until it reaches equilibrium.

Storm surge and seiches come about suddenly and unexpectedly, damaging shorelines, sinking ships, leaving ships high and dry, and causing flooding (Clark, 2005; Wittman 2005).

Records show that a seiche has occurred on all five of the Great Lakes.

Tsunami waves and seiche waves are often categorized together, but with two major differences. Seiche waves are much smaller than tsunami waves and are caused by wind and atmospheric pressure changes, while tsunami waves are much larger and caused by earthquakes. Lake Erie is known for producing the most and largest seiches of the five lakes, due to being the shallowest Great Lake. The southwest winds of Lake Erie frequently assemble seiches that affect the large cities of Toledo, OH and Buffalo, NY on opposite shores of Lake Erie.

These two graphs compare the water levels of two specific areas from November 11-13, 2003. You can see in Buffalo, NY, the water level rose rapidly and then slowly started to decrease back to normal. In comparison, the Fermi Power Plant, MI graph represents how the water level dropped quite quickly and then after a few hours it started to incline back to its original position (Alexander 2005).

As early as 1689, Baron La Hontan noted tide-like variations or seiches on his journeys of Lake Michigan. He noted that Green Bay would fluctuate three feet everyday and that the Straits of Mackinac had unusually strong currents. In 1721, French Jesuit Pierre de Charlevoix noted the water levels would change while traveling on Lake Ontario. Charlevoix noticed the water level fluctuated on the shoreline exposing and burying rocks daily. Another early explorer traveling the lakes, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, in 1721, observed and documented his findings of water levels on the Great Lakes. He noted in Green Bay, while using a stake driven into the shoreline, that the water levels on Green Bay actually did fluctuate but was not exactly sure why or how (Dennis 2003. pgs. 267-268).

Most seiches on the Great Lakes are small and not very destructive, dangerous or life threatening to people on land. Many seiches force ships to wait or dock in a harbor until the seiche has finished and it is safe to depart. Strong rip currents often accompany a seiche, causing very dangerous water fluctuations and movements of abnormal currents. Occasionally, a destructive and even deadly seiche attacks the shores of the Great Lakes. Many of the deadliest seiches have occurred on Lake Michigan with a few somewhat large and destructive seiches taking place on Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie (Dennis 2003. pgs. 22-23).

On July 4, 1929, over 45,000 people gathered in Grand Haven, MI to partake in holiday events at Grand Haven State Park, on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. A series of seiches attacked the Grand Haven shoreline after an early morning storm. The storm produced a seiche that generated into high winds and 20-foot waves. The seiche completely buried the Grand Haven pier sweeping people off and left helpless, while strong rip currents carried several more away from the beach. The deadly seiche of 1929 was responsible for taking ten lives to the mighty and fierce Lake Michigan (Alexander 2005).

Nine years later, on July 13, 1938, another deadly seiche came about on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, just 20 miles south of Grand Haven, in Holland, MI. It was a beautiful calm day on the beach at the Holland State Park. Later that day, a huge amount of water that was piled on the Wisconsin shore two days earlier due to an east wind, returned to Holland in the form of a seiche. The calm seas soon turned into monstrous ten-foot edge waves with fierce rip currents that swept people from the beach, pier and boats. The seiche of 1938 claimed another five lives on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan (The Joint Archives of Holland 2001).

On June 26, 1954, the southern basin of Lake Michigan experienced a seiche in numerous locations, including the entire Illinois shoreline. The seiche was caused by a squall line that started in Michigan City, IN. The seiche continued to build in size along the Illinois shore.

This diagram illustrates how the 1954 seiche formed and what areas were affected. Ten-foot waves struck North Avenue pier in downtown Chicago, IL. Fishermen were swept off the pier with many being rescued. Consequently, a Lake Michigan seiche yet again took the lives of eight people (Bauer 2005; Haas 2005). Chicago also has experienced such sudden and deadly waves (Haas 2005)

“A derecho, a widespread and long lived windstorm that is associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms, is yet another cause of a seiche” (NOAA 2005). In both 1995 and 1998, a fierce derecho invaded the Great Lakes region. On July 13, 1995 a derecho created a seiche on Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie. Extremely high wind gusts and changes in barometric pressure occurred on Lake Huron, the ingredients for a seiche.

This graph displays the wind speed at Tawas, the temperature and barometric pressure at Alpena, on July 13, 1995 near Lake Huron during the seiche. The seiche also produced water level changes on Lake Huron and Lake Erie, causing boats to capsize and rescues to be conducted.

This graph is an excellent example showing how quick the water levels can change within minutes and even hours at specific locations during a seiche (NOAA 1995).

On May 31, 1998, a destructive and devastating derecho hit the eastern shore of Lake Michigan between Ludington and Holland, with wind gusts over 100 mph and huge seiches. Inland, near Grand Rapids, wind gusts were reported as much as 130 mph. This line of winds created havoc on much of West Michigan, which was declared a Federal Disaster Area. Boats were destroyed, trees were annihilated, and power outages lasted for weeks.

This photo displays just a minimal amount of tree damage at Chinook Pier in Grand Haven, MI (NOAA 1998).

A seiche left many boats, in Grand Haven, MI, dangling in the air with just their dock lines holding them in their slip. “There was a huge gust, you could feel the pressure change, and all of a sudden the water rushed out and there we were lying in bed, dangling by a few scrawny dock lines”, explained Capt. Chip Klein of Hit Man Charters. “Many of the dock lines snapped due to the massive amount of weight they were holding”, said Klein. (Klein 2005).

This photo illustrates the amount of damage to charter boats at Chinook Pier in Grand Haven, MI. You can see the canvas tops are torn off; outriggers are bent or missing, and rods and reels are gone.The Stephen M. Asher tug boat, fell victim to a seiche on the morning of May 31, 1998 in Muskegon County. The tug boat sank in White Lake Channel as the water rushed back out from White Lake into Lake Michigan, causing the tug to roll on its side and sink. The crew survived the seiche and no one was injured as they all reached land safely (NOAA 1998).

Severe and deadly seiche events are rare on the Great Lakes. Storm surge, edge waves, rip currents, and seiches are often associated with strong wind, derechos, and thunderstorms. This is the time when seiches are talked about and most likely to generate damage, flooding, or even drowning.

These two photos are just another example of how dangerous a seiche can be. These two photos were taken on November 27, 2001, just minutes apart, at Canal Park in Duluth, MN. The first photo is showing storm surge and a man on the Canal Park path. The second photo, taken just minutes later, represents how quick and fierce a seiche can occur without warning.

Seiches occur on the Great Lakes everyday, sometimes hazardous, but mostly seiches go unnoticed as the lake is calm. People have always wondered why, when the lake is flat calm, there are still waves rolling onto the shorelines. This has to do with an assortment of atmospheric pressures that include rip currents, currents, seiches, and storm surges occurring quite possibly hundreds of miles away. Surface water on the Great Lakes can be moved hundreds of miles in just days. Take caution when in, near, or on a Great Lake and its tributaries. The Great Lakes are beautiful to most, hazardous to some, fierce and wicked to few. Take caution and respect the force and power of the mighty Great Lakes.

First poster for John Krokidas’ Kill Your Darlings

Sony Classics, via MovieFone, has released the first poster for John Krokidas’ Kill Your Darlings. The poster features a very yellow (aka indie) Dane DeHaan and Daniel Radcliffe looking glum.

The film is based on the true story of the murder of David Kammerer by Lucien Carr in 1944, which draws together the great poets of the beat generation: Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs.

Radcliffe stars as Ginsberg, with Ben Foster as Burroughs, Jack Huston as Kerouac, and DeHaan as Carr. The film also stars Michael C. Hall, Elizabeth Olsen, David Cross, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Kyra Sedgwick.

Kill Your Darlings has been chosen as the closing film at this year’s Cork Film Festival on November 19th, with the rest of the country getting it on December 6th.                                                                                                                                          0279642-4aa9eadc89a25271af544817d927b55f.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006123 00000000000 015135  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Springfield NAACP President Bishop Talbert Swan II reportedly joined more than two dozen national black leaders this week in challenging Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's stance on issues related to so-called "religious freedom."

Swan, the pastor of the Spring of Hope Church Of God In Christ and assistant general secretary for the National Church Of God In Christ, signed his name to an "Open Letter to Hillary Clinton Regarding Religious Freedom for Black America," Breitbart reported.

The letter, which was reportedly signed by more than 20 national black leaders and delivered to the Democrat's campaign headquarters on Monday, denounced rhetoric comparing religious freedom policies to "the apartheid of Jim Crow" laws.

"There is no analogy between the apartheid of Jim Crow and the religious freedom laws in force across this country," the letter stated. "It is the very same faith that is protected by religious freedom laws that inspired our black ancestors to lead the movement for the abolition of slavery and the end of Jim Crow apartheid in the American South."

Leaders further argued that "it is absurd to demean the defense of this faith as the equivalent of the injustices that we have fought and overcome," Breitbart reported.

Turning to Clinton's support for abortion-related policies, meanwhile, the leaders also took issue with the percentage of black babies aborted in the United States and urged the Democratic nominee to explain her stance on the contentious practice.

Arguing that "abortion in the black community has had a catastrophic impact," the leaders reportedly called on Clinton to justify her position.

"Black babies are dying at terrifying rates," they wrote in the letter. "How do you justify your unconscionable silence in the face of such destruction of innocent black life? Don't black lives matter?"

Pointing to crime, the leaders further argued that the former secretary of state's attitude toward religion undermines what has traditionally kept the black community together, according to Breitbart.

Eroding the religious freedom rights of the black church, they argued, prevents the church from impacting young men.

"The work of the black church in our poor communities is of the utmost importance and the importance of our freedom to operate in accordance with our faith cannot be overstated," they wrote.

Leaders called for a meeting with the Democratic nominee to discuss how her potential presidential administration would respond to such concerns, as well as how she would ensure protection of all Americans' constitutional freedoms.

Other Massachusetts leaders who reportedly joined Swan in signing the letter included: Rev. Mark V. Scott, of Azusa Christian Community in Boston; Jacqueline C. Rivers, of Seymour Institute for Black Church & Policy Studies in Boston; Bishop Gideon A. Thompson, of Church of God in Boston; Pastor Jamie Perdomo, of Iglesia Cristiana Nueva Vida in East Boston; Donna Desilus, of Azusa Christian Community in Boston; Rev. Vernard Coulter, of Missionary Baptist Church in Boston; and Pastor Egobudike Ezedi, of Empowerment Christian Center in Boston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279645-00d4d50edb89d3baeb2bc3f947822630.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003471 00000000000 015177  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        At some point between Feb. 25 and April 26, the Department of the Interior scrubbed nearly any mention of climate change from its webpage on the topic.

What was once a vigorous endorsement of the scientific consensus that the Earth is warming as a result of human activity — “Climate change affects every corner of the American continent. It is making droughts drier and longer, floods more dangerous and hurricanes more severe,” the webpage used to read — has now been whittled down to a single, vanilla paragraph:

“The impacts of climate change have led the Department to focus on how we manage our nation’s public lands and resources. The Department of the Interior contributes sound scientific research to address this and other environmental challenges.”

The department has yet to respond to TPM’s request for comment on the change, first reported by Vice’s Motherboard.

The publication noted similar incidents of sanitization since Trump’s inauguration at the EPA, whitehouse.gov and a regulatory page belonging to the Bureau of Land Management.

The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, which tracks changes to government websites, flagged the removal on that page, in the new administration’s first week, of rules on oil and gas extraction.

Climate change information on other agencies within the Department of Interior, including the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management, National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, appears relatively untouched.

Politico reported on March 29 that a supervisor at the Energy Department’s Office for International Climate and Clean Energy had instructed staff not to use the phrases “climate change,” “emissions reduction” or “Paris Agreement” in written communications, though a department spokesperson denied there had been any official change.                                                                                                                                                                                                       0279293-d549d9364b421945fcf4be32bc0bf714.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010335 00000000000 015127  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Derzsi Elekes Andor / CC BY-SA 2.0

Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft have embarked on an online crusade against the spread of terrorist organizations’ messages. According to a joint press release published Tuesday, the four tech companies have entered into a partnership to share information about content posted on their respective sites that has been deemed “online terrorist content.”

“Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of ‘hashes’—unique digital ‘fingerprints’—for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services,” states the press release, which can be found on Facebook’s website.

Social media sites have a troubled past with detecting radical messages on their platforms. For example, Facebook found a post on Tashfeen Malik’s alias account that pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State a day after she and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, killed 14 people in an attack in San Bernardino, Calif., last year.

“Social media is a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others,” Associated Press reports. “Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from ‘lone wolf’ attacks and decreased the time from ‘flash to bang’—or radicalization to violence—with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.”

The companies will allegedly not be in partnership with government entities, according to the news publication Quartz. “The database will not accept hashes flagged by governments and law enforcement,” Quartz reports. “Governments would need to submit formal requests for information maintained in it as they would for any other content inquiries.”

The tech companies will share the unique hashes “of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services—content most likely to violate all our respective companies’ content policies.” Each company can then locate content by the same user on their respective sites and delete anything that violates their policies in order to “curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.” The definition of what constitutes “terrorist content” will vary by company.

As they begin this endeavor, the companies say they are committed to protecting their users’ privacy: “No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed.”

The announcement of this partnership comes after the Obama administration asked for help from tech leaders in the fight against terrorism. During a summit meeting in Silicon Valley in January, the White House held a briefing on encryption that urged the tech sector to use its technology for counterterrorism efforts.

An excerpt of the White House briefing obtained by The Intercept reads:

We expect terrorists will continue to use technology to mobilize, facilitate, and operationalize attacks, including using encrypted communications where law enforcement cannot obtain the content of the communication even with court authorization. We would be happy to provide classified briefings in which we could share additional information. […] We are interested in exploring all options with you for how to deal with the growing threat of terrorists and other malicious actors using technology, including encrypted technology, to threaten our national security and public safety.

The social media giants have independently taken unofficial stands against terrorism before this partnership. Twitter has used its “proprietary spam-fighting tools” to take down more than 360,000 accounts in the past year that violated “its policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,” according to Sinead McSweeney, vice president of public policy and communications at Twitter.

In its policies, YouTube states it “strictly prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organizations, incite violence, celebrate terrorist attacks or otherwise promote acts of terrorism. We also do not permit foreign terrorist organizations to use YouTube.”

The partnership will most likely include more companies in the future.

Arriving by train, as many as 5,000 visitors at a time could relax in lavish quarters after taking advantage of the therapeutic waters of Lago Epecuén. The mountain lake was unusual in that its waters were saltier than any ocean—in fact, it was second only to the Dead Sea in salt content, and people suffering from depression, diabetes, and everything in-between came to soak in its healing waters—the very waters that would eventually harbor the village’s ruin.

In what can only be described as a freak occurrence, a rare weather pattern developed over Villa Epecuen in 1985, causing a seiche (standing wave) in the lake. The seiche broke a dam and then shoved its way through the dike. While the devastation was slow, it was thorough—the inevitable flood gradually devoured the entire village, submerging it under more than 30 ft. of briny waters. 280 businesses and countless personal dwellings disappeared under the surface like a modern-day Atlantis.

It wasn’t until 2009 that drier weather allowed the waters to retreat enough for the town to reemerge. The damage total, the village was deemed a disaster area offering no incentive to rebuild. What remains now is an eerie ghost town with rows and rows of dead, naked trees, decrepit buildings, and an entire landscape seemingly bleached out and stripped to the bone by the once-healing salt waters that ravaged everything in sight.           0279664-ca7d6ba41be656bc2f40735e8cb43006.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004742 00000000000 015177  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        PARIS (Reuters) - New Prime Minister Manuel Valls will test France’s political will to reform on Tuesday in a confidence vote that will determine whether the government can push ahead with a competitiveness drive.

Valls, appointed by President Francois Hollande last week after the ruling Socialists suffered an election rout, is to launch plans to phase out 30 billion euros ($41 billion) in payroll tax on companies in exchange for hiring.

Valls, one of France’s most popular politicians, is to outline his priorities in his first major policy speech at 15:00 (1300 GMT), before the confidence vote.

Hollande’s newly reshuffled government is facing growing resistance from erstwhile coalition partners the Greens and from the left, even within his own Socialist Party.

Their backing is vital for what Hollande has dubbed his “responsibility pact”, which includes plans to wring 50 billion euros in savings from the budget over three years.

“The French want action. We have to create the conditions for supporting growth,” Valls said on Monday on i>Tele television, promising concrete plans.

His Finance Minister Michel Sapin said Valls would offer details about where the budget savings will come from. A government source said central state spending would account for nearly 20 billion euros, spending by local authorities 10 billion and another 20 billion would be from the welfare system.

Concerned France’s deficit-reduction targets are slipping out of reach, the European Commission, the German government and credit ratings agencies all want to see precise details.

The new government has given mixed messages about whether it intends to stick to France’s deficit targets and any delay in meeting them will be a hard sell in Brussels and Berlin.

Hollande’s Socialists have 291 seats out of 577 in the lower house of parliament, but more than 80 backed a paper over the weekend calling for a change of policy after a drubbing in local elections last month.

The confidence vote could fail if there are more than 30 Socialist abstentions, although it also depends on what the Greens and other minor parties do.

To make Hollande’s responsibility pact more palatable, the government is preparing to lower the welfare charge deductions from the pay of workers on low incomes and to increase a minimum welfare benefit payment.                              0279225-21f1b849cedd9f898665c97f139d099e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000031037 00000000000 015114  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        It is good for the economy and good for American democracy when workers join together in unions, despite the claims of some conservatives who are waging a campaign to block important legislation that would make it easier to join a union.

Only 12 percent of American workers are currently represented by unions, and those who attempt to unionize face an uphill battle. The Employee Free Choice Act, which is likely to be one of the most important issues debated when the 111th Congress starts in January, holds the promise of restoring workplace democracy for workers attempting to organize, boosting unionization rates, and improving the economic standing and workplace conditions for millions of American workers.

The bill has previously passed the House and received majority support in the Senate, though the opposition of a few conservatives in the Senate has prevented the bill’s final passage. Yet next year the bill has a very strong chance of becoming law due to the election of several progressive senators in November and President-elect Barack Obama’s promises of support.

Consider these facts:

Unions are good for all workers. They improve wages, benefits, and working conditions, and helped create the middle class.

Unions raise wages for all workers. Unions paved the way to the middle class for millions of workers and pioneered benefits along the way, including paid health care and pensions. Even today, union workers earn significantly more on average than non-union counterparts and union employers are more likely to provide benefits. Workers in low-wage industries, women, African-American, and Latino workers have higher wages in unionized workplaces. Even non-union workers—particularly in highly unionized industries—receive financial benefits from employers who increase wages to match what unions would win in order to avoid unionization.

Workers in low-wage industries, women, African-American, and Latino workers have higher wages in unionized workplaces. Even non-union workers—particularly in highly unionized industries—receive financial benefits from employers who increase wages to match what unions would win in order to avoid unionization. Without unions, fewer workers get ahead. Shrinking union membership hurts all Americans. Corporations rather than workers are increasingly rewarded for growth in the economy. Long before the current financial crisis began, working families were struggling to make ends meet. American productivity has expanded by nearly 16 percent since 2001, but most of that economic boom bypassed workers, and real wages have remained flat . Corporate profits have meanwhile doubled since 2001, according to Moody economist Mark Zandi. Not since the 1920s has the link between economic growth and the well-being of the middle class been so tenuous. Labor’s decline squeezes the middle class, raises inequality, and undermines democratic values.

Unions are good for the economy. They can help foster a competitive high-wage, high-productivity economic strategy.

Higher wages are competitive. Critics argue that union wages are too high and make it hard for American employers to compete globally. Yet competitiveness is also linked to productivity, quality, and innovation—all of which can be enhanced with higher wages. Henry Ford found in 1914 that paying employees $5 per day—double the auto industry’s prevailing wage—reduced turnover, allowing him to cut the price of the Model T and increase profits significantly. Ford commented that the $5 day was one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made.

Ford commented that the $5 day was one of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made. Unionization and high worker productivity often go hand-in-hand. Fairness on the job and wages that reflect marketplace success contribute to more motivated workers. Given the pressures of globalization and competitiveness today, unions have been responsive to increasing productivity and embracing new innovations. In the retail world, labor costs in 2005 for partially unionized retailer Costco were 40 percent higher than Sam’s Club, but Costco produced almost double the operating profit per hourly employee in the United States—$21,805 per employee versus $11,615 per employee.

Unions are good for democracy. They give workers a voice on the job and in politics, and have been essential to the passage of some of the most important legislation of the past 100 years.

Unions improve communication between workers and managers. Unions give workers a voice on the job and improve communication between workers and management. Without unions, day-to-day competitive pressures leave quitting as the only option for workers to address serious problems—an expensive solution for all concerned.

Without unions, day-to-day competitive pressures leave quitting as the only option for workers to address serious problems—an expensive solution for all concerned. Unions have helped pass important legislation that helps all Americans. In the political arena, unions have pressed for improved minimum wages, health care coverage, retirement plan protections, overtime pay, and social security. When workers are able to join together in a democracy, the voice of workers can help balance out the power of business interests.

When workers are able to join together in a democracy, the voice of workers can help balance out the power of business interests. Unions foster political participation. Unions are democratic membership organizations and foster the political participation of their members. They educate their members about the political process and train them how to work together for a common goal.

The Employee Free Choice Act is needed. Under current law, workers are often denied workplace freedoms and face a Herculean task joining a union.

Workers attempting to unionize are often intimidated. Workers attempting to unionize face a hostile legal environment and aggressive antiunion employers. Expensive antiunion campaigns often seek to influence workers’ votes by using threats—sometimes that the wrong vote could cost workers their jobs—one-on-one pressure, and mandatory meetings. One out of five union organizers or activists is likely to be fired during union election campaigns.

One out of five union organizers or activists is likely to be fired during union election campaigns. The current law is a failure. Labor law contains few penalties for employers who routinely harass, intimidate, and even fire people who try to join a union. Even after a vote in favor of unionization, employers often exercise their available rights of appeal and engage in bad-faith bargaining as a delay tactic that can go on for years.

Workers want to join unions. Only 12 percent of American workers today are members of unions—but that’s not because they don’t want to be. A December 2006 Peter Hart Research Associates Poll reports that 58 percent of non-managerial American workers would join a union if they could.

The Employee Free Choice Act would restore workers’ voices. The bill would make joining a union and getting a first contract fairer and easier.

The Employee Free Choice Act promotes workers’ rights. The bill would reform the labor-relations system to restore workers’ basic democratic right to make a free choice to join a union.

The bill would reform the labor-relations system to restore workers’ basic democratic right to make a free choice to join a union. The Employee Free Choice Act is fair. It would ensure fairness in the union selection process through three main provisions: workers would have a fair and direct path to join unions through simple majority sign-up, employers who break the rules governing the unionization process would face stiffer penalties, and a first contract mediation and arbitration process would be introduced to thwart bad-faith bargaining.

The Employee Free Choice Act is democratic and restores previously won rights. The bill would allow workers to join a union through simple majority sign-up or an election—as previous labor law allowed.

The Employee Free Choice Act allows majority sign up or an election. The bill would allow an employee to choose to join a union through simple majority sign-up—a system that works well at the small number of workplaces that choose to permit it. The act does not deny workers their right to vote in a union election, as some conservatives maintain, but rather allows workers to choose between signing a membership card and having an election.

Workers won rights in 1935. Workers won important collective bargaining protections over 70 years ago with the passage of the Wagner Act. The Wagner Act placed the federal government squarely on the side of collective bargaining and the right to organize. An employer’s duty was to remain completely neutral in a representation election, in recognition that economic dependence defines the relationship between employers and workers. Employer persuasion could not be separated from employer coercion.

Employer persuasion could not be separated from employer coercion. The Wagner Act promoted majority sign up. Elections were just one way for workers to unionize during the 1930s. The National Labor Relations Board only required an election when genuine questions arose around a majority sign-up process. Almost a third of all union certifications between 1938 and 1939 occurred without an election according to labor historian Dr. David Brody, and under these legal rules millions of workers exercised their basic democratic rights, pouring into unions. Unfortunately, important safeguards requiring employer neutrality during union selection processes began to be dismantled starting in the 1940s. The Taft Hartley Act took away the NLRB’s right to certify unions with simple majority sign up in 1947—employers from that point on could recognize their workers’ petition, or request an additional election—where rules favor the employer.

The Employee Free Choice Act is necessary to restore workers’ rights, boost the wages and benefits of Americans, and strengthen our economy. Passing the bill would help restore workplace democracy for workers attempting to organize, boost unionization rates, and improve the economic standing and workplace conditions for millions of American workers.

The U.S. Africa Command said the two drone strikes killed "several terrorists" in northeastern Somalia, with the first around midnight local time and the second later Friday morning. The U.S. said the strikes were carried out in coordination with Somalia's government.

Local officials confirmed the strikes. At least six missiles struck in Buqa, a remote mountainous village roughly 37 miles north of Qandala town in the northern state of Puntland, a Somali security official told The Associated Press.

The airstrike may have targeted top leaders of the group, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Impact of U.S. strikes on Syria air base

The mayor of Qandala, Jama Mohamed, said the strikes sent terrified nomadic villagers and their animals fleeing.

The U.S. military this year has carried out well over a dozen drone strikes against al-Shabab extremists after the Trump administration approved expanded efforts against the group. Al-Shabab has been blamed for carrying out Somalia's deadliest attack last month, a massive truck bombing in the capital, Mogadishu, that killed more than 350 people. Somalia's president has vowed a "state of war," with neighbors sending in thousands of troops to help the local military and an African Union force.

But ISIS-linked fighters who have split from the Somalia-based al-Shabab pose a growing threat in Puntland.

In May, ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing in Puntland -- said to be the first time the extremist group had claimed an attack in the Horn of Africa nation. Police said a suicide bomber detonated at a military checkpoint in the commercial hub of Bossaso, killing at least four people.

A report by United Nations experts monitoring sanctions against ISIS noted in a report circulated in August the "terrorist threat" posed by its affiliates in Puntland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0279673-087a1ab7eac5c3d0fe33f52a2f3c2920.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000013104 00000000000 015240  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Aaron Hamm, an assistant hotel engineer who deals with HVAC, cooling systems, and maintenance, lacks the traditional qualifications to be an astronaut. But that doesn't mean he wants to stay on Earth. "I felt… I was discouraged as a child [from becoming an astronaut] just because of how unbelievably competitive it is,” Hamm told Ars. “I’m a very intelligent person and I’m driven to try and achieve my dreams but, at the same time, I felt like it was an really unrealistic goal to try and pursue. As smart as I am, there's always plenty of people that are smarter.”

Hamm, an Ars forum user by the name of Quisquis, has just applied for the private Mars One colony program. For him, a large part of the appeal is that the program seeks a different type of astronaut.



“I think that the Mars One mission and the idea of going somewhere that you're not coming back from for life… that's different than the general astronaut program,” he said. Hamm also emphasized his own pioneer spirit, which he will need if accepted—there’s no return journey planned for Mars One colonists.

A new horizon

Mars One is a private space mission that hopes to send a group of people to Mars in a decade and leave them there to foster the first human colony. It has received endorsement and support from the likes of Gerard ’t Hooft, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. But it has also been criticized on several counts, including treating a serious life-threatening scenario as a reality show for the purposes of monetization and seeking funding while being glib about nearly all the practical details.

Before applicants even get to see the application, they must pay an application fee of around $38 USD (the price varies depending on country of residence). They fill out a public-facing profile and answer several private questions about achievements and awards, incidents that have frightened or stressed them out and how they dealt with them, personality types they find difficult to handle, and how they deal with cultures other than their own. To date, 30,000 other Red Planet hopefuls have applied.

“I want to see the sun rise over a completely new horizon, in a completely new sky. I think that's worth any price,” wrote Erica Meszaros, another Mars One applicant, in her personal essay.

Meszaros is a software developer by trade and interned with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab. She states that astronauts are traditionally chosen “from the Air Force” or—more recently, with the success of $200,000 per flight projects like Virgin Galactic—from “those with deep pockets.”

Part of Mars One’s pitch has been that much of the technology for traveling to and maintaining residence on Mars already exists; it’s just a matter of marshaling resources and initiative to get there. Both Hamm and Meszaros echoed this sentiment. Despite being publicly vague on the details, Mars One leaders maintain that they know the cost of the mission ($6 billion) and that it can all be assembled and launched in 10 years.

All applicants make a video as part of their public facing profile discussing, in brief, why they want to or are suited for a mission to Mars. "I have a great sense of humor, so I really get along with everybody," said Francisco, a 32 year-old Argentinian man who works in "the commercial area at a plastic containers factory."

"I’ve got a feeling that I don’t belong here, but out there,” said Anders, a 51-year-old Swedish man who has the most popular profile on the site. “What makes me the perfect candidate? Well, I’m single. I’m flexible."

"I believe that the challenge that I’m putting up with everybody… If anybody can challenge me with the knowledge and all the things that I can do, then I give up, but if not, I would like to be the first one to go,” said Vasile Sofroni, a 54-year-old Romanian man with the second most popular profile.

The technical viability of the project has been repeatedly called into question, though detailed critiques are hard to come by because the project is so vague (the New York Times summed up the general feeling in a recent article that talked about the "significant skepticism" that Mars One "has raised in some quarters").

Critics also criticized Mars One for its attempt to turn the trip into an extravagant and potentially dangerous reality TV show. The first round of the application process allows people to vote on applicants based on their public profiles to push them through to the next qualifying round (though there is not, per the current design, any public involvement going forward).



But neither Hamm nor Meszaros see themselves as fame seekers. “I don’t, right now, have a strategy for progressing, other than trying to get across my passion… for this endeavor,” Meszaros told me. Hamm said that he has been pushing his application and name out on sites like Facebook (“my friends are already a little tired of it”) but notes he has “never applied to another reality show.”

Worth the risk

By now, Mars One has proven that there are sufficient number of people who don't need to know any technical details for about the potential chance to live on Mars. Tens of thousands have plunked down cash to throw their would-be astronaut helmets into the ring without needing virtually any concrete information.

But should space travel push come to reality entertainment shove, aren’t applicants at least a little afraid of—how to put this delicately—either a fiery space death or a frigid Martian death?

“The purpose that I would be pursuing is so much greater than myself,” Hamm said. “I think the benefit to humanity is overwhelming of those fears.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            0279677-5aa2916f8bb2bdd6b8dc5b9c8916cf37.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010260 00000000000 015363  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        When doctors told preacher Todd Burpo his four-year-old son was going to die from a burst appendix he railed against God for taking him to heaven too soon.

What he did not expect was that little Colton would not only survive his near-death experience on the operating table but would come back full of stories of the angels and rainbows he had seen while unconscious.

He told his parents that while visiting heaven he met John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary, and sat at Jesus’s knee.

His extraordinary claims have now been turned into a film, Heaven is for Real, which has become a huge word of mouth hit across America and is due to open in Britain next week.

It was only when the little boy described in detail watching his father as he shouted in despair at God in a hotel anteroom, something he could not have known about, that Mr Burpo began to believe he was dealing with more than a little boy’s drug-induced hallucinations.

Colton went on to recognise a photograph of a great-grandfather he had never met and talked about a sister he said told him she had "died in their mother’s tummy".

The family had never discussed the baby his mother Sonja lost to a miscarriage a year before Colton’s birth, or told him about his father's rant against God as he lay on the operating table.

These details helped to convince them that Colton’s claims were true, and Mr Burpo went on to write a book about his experiences.

Also called Heaven is for Real, it became an unlikely bestseller, spending three years at the top of the charts. Now, 10 years after Colton’s brush with death on a hospital operating table, it has been made into a film starring Greg Kinnear as Todd Burpo.

Opening on Easter weekend, the movie was an instant hit, taking $22.5 million (£13.4 million) in its first three days and easily overshadowing Transcendence, a blockbuster starring Johnny Depp which had been expected to dominate the box offices.

Not surprisingly, the film appears to have struck a particular chord in the Bible Belt of the American Mid-West, where it has played to rapturous and often tearful crowds who seem to view Colton’s claims as gospel.

But critics have warned against taking the little boy’s particularly childlike visions of riding a rainbow-coloured horse in heaven while being serenaded by angels singing Jesus Loves You too literally.

He also described Jesus as having “brown hair, a brown beard, a very bright smile and his eyes were just beautiful sea blue”.

In her review of the book, Susan Jacoby, who billed herself as “The Spirited Atheist” on her blog for the Washington Post, said: "Only in America could a book like this be classified as non-fiction.

“At age four, an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality is charming. But among American adults, widespread identification with the mind of a ­preschooler is scary.”

Even some members of Mr Burpo’s own Baptist congregation in their home town of Imperial, Nebraska, were initially wary of his claims, something he found particularly upsetting.

But the family has now got used to dealing with scepticism, and continue to deny that they or anyone else coached Colton to come up with his extraordinary story.

Mr Burpo told the Huffington Post: “Colton knew things that no four-year-old could have known, things no Sunday School teacher would have taught him.

“This is not a Christian film with a whitewashed easy story where everything turns out fine and life is easy. This is our real life. It's not fiction at all, this is real and I want people to know that and be given hope”.

Colton himself, now a 14-year-old would-be musician, continues to believe fervently that he died and went briefly to heaven while surgeons fought for his life, and uses his experiences to comfort children suffering from terminal illnesses.

He says he is a big fan of the film, although its makers haven’t quite captured the glories he has seen.

“They do a good job but they haven’t experienced it like I have,” he said. “Heaven is just so much better than that.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0279693-716014f8a9d8016d395b079b329efc95.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000020450 00000000000 014730  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        If the Internet was desperate for a new meme, Ken Bone delivered. The IZOD junkie and former Christian rock drummer was the breakout star of Sunday night’s bloody presidential debate, which saw Republican nominee Donald Trump throw everything but the kitchen sink at his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Bone, an undecided voter tapped by Gallup, asked the candidates an earnest, straightforward question about energy policy and quickly became the Internet’s cause célèbre. His now-iconic red sweater, the epitome of Omaha chic, sold out within a matter of hours as shoppers planned their Halloween costumes.

For many, Bone represented the humanity lacking in this year’s election. Prior to the mild-mannered swing voter’s question, Trump threatened to have Clinton thrown in prison. He brought up her husband’s alleged sexual assaults, even inviting the women who claimed that Bill Clinton abused them to the debate. Trump repeatedly interrupted her and lashed out at the moderators for intervening. He even compared Clinton to “the devil.” In contrast, Bone’s presence was a respite from the ugliness — and even comforting. “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah called him a “one-man basket of adorables,” while Twitter user @zacthezac commented that Bone “looks like the human version of a hug.” A parody Twitter account imagines Bone as a folk hero in the vein of Jimmy Stewart’s Mr. Smith, the only good guy left in America.

There’s an air of condescension, however, to Bone’s embrace that’s unshakable. Shortly after he became a household name, the red-sweatered swing voter spawned a “sexy” Halloween costume. He was offered a porn contract. Former boy bander Joe Jonas even inquired as to whether Bone is single — as long as he decides to vote for Clinton, that is. When a friend of mine expressed confusion over the Bone phenomenon, I explained that it was like when you claim something bad is actually “awesome,” illustrating your ironic enjoyment of it. Thus, if someone were to ask your opinion of “The Room,” the so-bad-it’s-good disasterpiece often referred to as “the worst movie ever made,” you might say it’s “great.” You do not actually think it is great.

Memes are inherently dehumanizing. To become a meme, an image must be dissociated from its reality and turned into something else. In linguistics terms, it’s a sign whose signifier is malleable — the image’s meaning, thus, is created by those who share it. When Maggie Goldenberger was in elementary school, she and her friends decided to dress up as characters of their own invention for a fun photoshoot. Goldenberger, whose favorite persona she called “Pervy Dale,” put her hair in pigtails and picked out an old vest from a box of accessories that belonged to a friend. The young girl held up a stack of “Goosebumps” books and flashed a demented smile, braces aglow as if she’d just won the lottery. It was a game, just a joke between friends, one not meant to be seen by millions.

Years later, that private photo became “ERMAHGERD Girl,” one of the most enduringly popular memes on the Internet. The figure is associated with a kind of innocent, pre-ironic excitement, harkening back to a time when getting your monthly shipment of Scholastic books was a very big deal. For Goldenberg, though, the unwanted attention came with a downside. The people sharing the meme tracked down her identity. One even posted a bikini photo of her. It could have been worse: Blake Boston, the man behind “Scumbag Steve,” claims that his family and girlfriend were harassed after an old photo of himself posing for his mother’s photo project went viral. People called his house. They hurled racist slurs at him. After getting a copy of his unborn daughter’s ultrasound, one troll told him that he hoped the child would die.

The case of Ken Bone is very different. While he claims that fans have telephoned his family, no one has wished death upon his offspring. In fact, most of it seems rather innocent — like obsessing over the fact that your grandmother still has a Motorola Razr flip phone. Bone’s normcore appeal is similar to that of Barb, the doomed best friend from Netflix’s cult hit “Stranger Things.” She’s who everyone seems to believe they were in high school, even if they were not: the awkward girl who asked for extra homework and stayed home on Friday night to organize her rock collection. Barb, whose daily wardrobe consists of mom jeans and giant glasses, is so uncool that she’s way cool — like your dad’s Members Only jacket.

That’s fine and dandy when the object of ironic enjoyment is a fictional character who doesn’t have to live the rest of her life after becoming a viral meme. If Barb’s face is emblazoned on street art and Etsy t-shirts, that’s gravy for the actress who plays her, Shannon Purser. “Stranger Things” was the up-and-comer’s first TV role, and becoming a meme might lead to bigger and better parts. After all, it’s just a character, not who Purser really is. When it’s a real person, the tone takes on what my friend Mark Shrayber referred to in Uproxx as a “subtler form of playground bullying.” You can’t call Ken Bone “fat and bald,” because that would be mean, but you can compare him to one of the characters from the board game “Guess Who.” On the Internet, fan appreciation sometimes look a lot like trolling.

What’s the difference between the two? It’s hard to define, but like a cubic zirconia, you know it when you see it. For instance, tweets commenting on his weight or appearance are obviously over the line. Take this one from @kathiemrr: “He's not fat. He's Ken big bone.” Others have compared him to Jerry Gergich, the overweight oaf from “Parks and Rec” who memorably had a fart attack. Those are easy to call. But what about the tweets calling for Bone to run as a third party candidate — or even suggesting that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize? Are they really celebrating a nice guy who just happened to be thrown into the political spotlight or are they doing something else? And what happens to Bone when it all goes away?

Bone, who works at a power plant, has said that he’s ready to go back to life as usual and cash out when his 15 minutes are up. After all, he’s just the latest middle American voter to find themselves a fleeting media sensation; there was also Tito the Builder and Joe the Plumber. In the meantime, he’s making the most of his fame. After reactivating his old Twitter account, Bone has accrued over 200,000 followers; he tweets Dad Jokes and musings about the absurdity of Internet fame. “Just saw this,” Bone posted along with a photo of himself he received in his junk email. “I'm spam now! That's the mark of a real fake celebrity.” He’s so self-aware and such a good sport that it’s hard to be mad that he’s getting the attention, even if he has started shilling for Uber. If he wants to take Twitter’s hollow applause to the bank, I say “bravo.”

Of course, the scrutiny has its drawbacks. After Bone sat for a Reddit AMA under his Internet alias, StanGibson18, intrepid users linked the handle to some unsavory comments made about Trayvon Martin and Jennifer Lawrence. In 2012, Martin was shot and killed by a volunteer neighborhood watch patrolman, George Zimmerman, who fired on the 16-year-old because he claims he felt unsafe. In a Reddit thread, Bone called his death “legally justified.” He previously admitted to looking at naked pictures of J-Law, one of the celebrities whose nudes were leaked by hackers in 2014. Many of Bone’s fans, upon learning that he is not their fantasy in-joke but rather someone with human flaws and complications, couldn’t run from him fast enough.

The Internet is on the verge of ignoring what made this a memorable moment to begin with: Bone’s question was a reminder that this no good, horrible, very bad election affects actual humans, whose livelihoods are dependent on the outcome of the election on Nov. 8. It’s not about the Orange Hitler or the competent, accomplished woman who just wants to get elected already so she can go about doing her job. It’s about the everyday Americans who continue to be caught in the crossfire of an increasingly ugly race. It’s OK to make Ken Bone a star, but let’s remember that he’s a person first, not your meme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        0279624-c64485961e8644bf772ebaccb7538afd.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010273 00000000000 015226  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Last Monday, U.S. head coach Jill Ellis announced the 20-player roster for February's CONCACAF Women’s Olympic Qualifying Championship. While FIFA Women's World Player of the Year Carli Lloyd and Morgan Brian will both represent the U.S. for Qualifying in Texas, their Houston Dash teammate Kealia Ohai's name was not among the selectees.

Neither were the names of Seattle Reign FC defender Lauren Barnes, her teammates Keelin Winters and Beverly Yanez, Washington Spirit midfielder Christine Nairn or even FC Kansas City midfielder Erika Tymrak. Similar to Ohai, their success in the NWSL has failed to translate into a spot in the American player pool.

At 17, Mallory Pugh stands out as the youngest player to be named to the U.S. Olympic Qualifying roster. She made headlines during the NWSL Draft with speculation she could forgo college for a professional career in the NWSL. However, the Denver Post confirmed she passed on a contract with Portland Thorns FC and will attend UCLA in the fall.

But why the sudden proclamation of Pugh? Could the Colorado teenager become a generational talent? And how has she leaped above current NWSL players in order to earn a spot on the Olympic Qualifying roster?

Retired Reign FC midfielder Mariah Bullock made an important tweet addressing the roster announcement.

Excited for young, new faces; but can't help but feel the door is closing/closed for most NWSL players. — Mariah Nogueira (@MariahNogy) January 26, 2016

It's hard not to share the same sentiment as Bullock.

Ohai still has yet to earn her first senior national team call-up.

Ohai being left off the Qualifying roster spells of another missed opportunity in the Dash forward's development, a player in need of international experience at the highest level. At 24, it's conceivable Ohai could join Barnes, Yanez and Winters in an unfortunate quartet of talented domestic players who have never been given a fair shot at international success.

With the wave of retirements at the end of Victory Tour, 2016 appeared to be a year for change in the senior national team. Prior to the roster announcement there was a sense of anticipation and hope in the idea the upcoming selections could result in a stroke of change and create new opportunities for existing NWSL players.

But now a month in it appears to be the same old from Ellis, a broken selection process that resembles the plot of "Groundhog Day."

A closer look at the Olympic Qualifying roster begs the question, has Ellis replaced the NWSL with college as the breeding ground for the USWNT? A clear reversal in stance from Tom Sermanni who utilized the domestic league in his brief tenure.

Ellis' selections feature a familiar crop of players, minus the subtractions of Whitney Engen and Heather O’Reilly, the latter of which will likely leverage her play in the NWSL to earn her way back onto the Olympic team in Rio.

To field a younger roster Ellis added, Boston Breakers forward Stephanie McCaffrey, Western New York Flash defender Jaelene Hinkle, her teammate Samantha Mewis, 2015 NWSL MVP Spirit forward Crystal Dunn, recent first-overall pick Emily Sonnett and Pugh. All of whom are under the age of 24 and previously received call-ups as part of the expanded 31-player Victory Tour roster in October. They have also been a part of the senior national team player pool since college with the exception of Hinkle and Pugh, a high school senior.

Interestingly enough Ohai played alongside roster members Julie Johnston, Dunn, Brian and Mewis in the 2012 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. Since then, she's won a national championship with Dunn, was selected second overall in the 2014 NWSL College Draft while Dunn went first, led the Dash in scoring in her rookie season while Johnston won Rookie of the Year and followed it up with a terrific sophomore campaign alongside Brian. Not only did she mature as a leader over the course of last season, but she brought the Dash one spot away from the club's first playoff appearance and made noticeable strides as a playmaker and facilitator.

The stunning lack of progression in Ohai's journey from the NWSL to USWNT creates the perception of a struggle which only feels right summed up by the iconic Tom Cruise "Jerry Maguire" quote, "Help me, help you."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     0279659-0cda5b014da28cdca6dcca7df511cd74.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005217 00000000000 015546  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In 1971, Walt Disney World opened in Florida, the voting age in the United States was lowered from 21 to 18, the Pentagon Papers were published by the New York Times and Campbell’s new city hall was built. It was a historical year globally, nationally and locally.

In Campbell, it was both a year of preservation and of gazing toward the Orchard City’s future. When city hall at 70 N. 1st St. was built, a time capsule was buried beneath the nearby clock tower close to the veterans’ memorial. The capsule will be opened in 2071.

“I’ve gotten quite a few inquiries about when it will be opened,” said Councilman Michael Kotowski, who had previously served on council from 1983 to 1992.

According to minutes from a Feb. 10, 1971 city council meeting, resident Lilyan Brannon asked the city to consider a time capsule to commemorate the city hall’s completion.

In keeping with the time theme, a clock tower was planned for the site as well. According to the Campbell Historical Museum records and archives, the clock tower was cut out of civic center plans due to cost. The Campbell Chamber of Commerce adopted the project and held fundraising events to get the clock erected the same year at city hall.

The cost of the clock was estimated at $5,000. A movie fundraiser geared toward children raised $2,700 and a donation of $1,700 from an anonymous person helped get the clock tower built. The tower was dedicated Sept. 25, 1971.

So what’s in that time capsule?

Mike Williams, a former resident now living in Nevada, told this newspaper over the phone he remembers placing photos in the capsule before it was buried. The 55-year-old is preparing his will and plans to inform his future grandchildren and great-grand-children about what waits for them in the capsule.

Williams said his mom, DeAun Smethurst, was the den mother of his Cub Scout troop that added items to the capsule. The troop of six boys submitted a group photo taken at the Sunnyoaks Fire Station when it first opened in 1969. The scouts also planted a tree by the capsule.

“We were asked to put a photo of us in there,” Smethurst said. “We thought it was pretty neat. Not everyone gets to be in a time capsule.”

Details about the remaining contents of the capsule will remain under wraps until 2071.

As for the future of the clock tower and the civic center, city officials are working on a master plan that will lay the groundwork for a new city hall, library and police headquarters.

In preliminary draft plans, the city has not addressed what it will do with the clock and the capsule. Civic center plans have not been finalized and construction will not begin until the city can fund the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0279635-2a0734604a79b738616d784c95555576.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012171 00000000000 014432  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The alleged kidnapping, torture and rape of detainees in Afghanistan by US armed forces are coming under more scrutiny at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.

Chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda's annual Preliminary Examination Activities report for 2015 found that "members of the US armed forces and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) resorted to techniques amounting to the commission of the war crimes of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape."

The prosecutors have found evidence that 61 detainees were subjected to "torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity" in Afghanistan between May 2003 and December 2014 (mostly at the outset of the war in 2003 and 2004). Meanwhile, the CIA is being investigated for the same crimes - as well as rape - against 27 detainees in Afghanistan and secret prisons in Poland, Romania and Lithuania.

Fatou Bensouda presented the report this week

Systematic cruelty

The ICC also underlined that the alleged crimes seemed to have been part of an officially sanctioned system "approved at senior levels of the US government." "The alleged crimes were not the abuses of a few isolated individuals," it read. "Rather, they appear to have been committed as part of approved interrogation techniques in an attempt to extract 'actionable intelligence' from detainees."

This systematic nature of the crimes increased their "gravity," the report added, and caused considerable suffering: "Some victims reportedly exhibited psychological and behavioral issues, including hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation."

Andreas Schüller, program director for international crimes at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), welcomed the report, but emphasized that this was just part of a wider examination, and that the ICC itself was part of an international judicial process that also involves military and civilian courts in the US and elsewhere: there are criminal investigations and pending court cases ongoing in Spain, Germany, Poland, Romania and Lithuania into alleged crimes committed by the CIA - either because they were perpetrated on their territories or with the collusion of their security forces.

The ECCHR itself filed a lawsuit on behalf of the German-Lebanese man Khalid el Masri, who was a victim of the CIA's extraordinary rendition program and says he spent several months being tortured in Afghanistan.

"You also have cases currently open on Guantanamo against US officials by the French judiciary, where former Guantanamo commander Geoffrey Miller has been summoned earlier this year to appear as an accused witness," said Schüller. (Miller, a retired US army general, ignored the summons.)

Overcoming the obstacles

The fact that the US, like many African countries, is not a party to the ICC is not an obstacle to the investigation. For one thing, Afghanistan ratified the Rome Statute that underpins the court in 2003, and therefore any crimes carried out on its territory (whether by military personnel or not) are within ICC jurisdiction.

German citizen Khalid el Masri was abused in Afghanistan by CIA agents

Moreover, as the ICC itself pointed out in a statement on Tuesday, its prosecutor's office is obliged to investigate all alleged crimes brought to its attention, regardless of potential legal problems. In the case of Afghanistan, prosecutors said on Tuesday that they will decide "imminently" whether to seek authorization to open a full-scale investigation.

But whether that will ever lead to any prosecutions of CIA agents is very doubtful. "It's not realistic, because the US has not ratified the statute, and even if it had, the US government has said repeatedly that it will not extradite any of its citizens to the ICC," said Wolfgang Heinz, senior policy adviser at the German Institute for Human Rights.

US State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said Tuesday that an ICC probe into the actions of US personnel in Afghanistan would not be "warranted or appropriate," adding that the US had its own "system of accountability."

"We have extensively examined our own activities. In many cases people were held accountable," she said.

Nevertheless, should the ICC decide to pursue its investigations and if it identifies US suspects living in other countries, it could seek their extradition. "That's been done before - the US embassy will apply pressure of course, but then you're not absolutely safe," Heinz said.

There are also other judicial options: the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) can prosecute European governments suspected of colluding in the CIA's human rights abuses. This has happened before: in 2014, the Polish government was convicted of collusion in the CIA's extraordinary rendition program and ordered to pay compensation to two men.

The US' alleged crimes are not the only ones related to the Afghanistan war being examined - those perpetrated by the Taliban, other anti-government groups, and Afghan government forces are also mentioned in the report, as are war crimes by various parties in eight other conflict zones around the world - in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and South America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0279596-1ac6e6b5ce3a1288fa27bc1b5b6c71ad.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002337 00000000000 015416  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Andrew Shaw had a good game going in his regular-season debut for the Montreal Canadiens, drawing a penalty early on, and scoring his first goal with the team to give them a comfortable lead in the third.

At the end of the game, however, his hot-headed nature came to the fore, and he was given a five-minute major for a slew-foot, which also came with a game misconduct.

He has already faced supplementary discipline in his short time with the Habs, being suspended for three pre-season games for boarding Washington Capitals player Connor Hobbs in Shaw’s first game of action with his new team.

He was also suspended for a homophobic slurs in Chicago’s playoff run last season; three games of action before the Hobbs incident.

With the previous suspension for the physical boading foul, Shaw will be seen as a repeat offender, which could increase the number of games he’s banned for should the NHL’s Department of Player Safety deem the slewfoot worthy of a suspension.

The team wanted to add Shaw for his hard-nosed style, but there’s nothing in these two cases that can be interpreted as helping his team win.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0279641-8971883c099b46a7f6bb030a8c0f154c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007145 00000000000 014775  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        SEATTLE — Late Friday night, time was running out on CC Sabathia’s 37th birthday, which he celebrated by hurling five solid innings in a 5-1 win over the Mariners.

Because Sabathia’s contract expires at the end of the year, he was asked if where he might work next season had filtered into his head.

Sabathia explained he is focused on helping the Yankees get to the postseason and how the business side of baseball has a way of working itself out.

Then he told The Post, “Obviously my first choice is here.’’

At the start of spring training, it was easy to see Sabathia wearing another cap next season. He was in the final year of a contract that pays him $25 million for this season, 36 years old, and despite a solid 2016 he was 32-39 in the past four years.

Now, the Yankees have to give serious thought to bringing Sabathia back because of how he has pitched, the decline of Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda lost due to Tommy John surgery, rookie Jordan Montgomery tailing off and top pitching prospect James Kaprielian also undergoing Tommy John and being lost for the year.

“Right now I am in the middle of this,’’ Sabathia said of the AL East race, in which the Yankees were tied for second with the Rays and 3 ½ games back of the first-place Red Sox entering Saturday’s game against the Mariners at Safeco Field. “I haven’t given a lot of thought to it. I have always let things take care of themselves, and it seems to have worked. Hopefully it will work again.’’

Without Sabathia, who is 9-3 with a 3.44 ERA in 16 starts, the Yankees wouldn’t be in the race. And if he hadn’t missed two-plus weeks with a strained left hamstring, they might be closer.

As always, general manager Brian Cashman didn’t delve into the future of a player while a season is underway.

“Now is not the time for that. I wouldn’t say if we were or were not,’’ the general manager said when asked if the Yankees’ brass had discussed Sabathia’s future internally. “We are in the stretch drive of the pennant race.’’

With Sabathia heading a rotation that could use a boost before the July 31 trade deadline.

“He has been great, has been leading the staff and a big leader in the clubhouse and performing very well on the field,’’ Cashman said.

With deep roots in North Jersey, Sabathia has often talked about staying there whenever the end arrives.

At his age, it is possible Sabathia will copy Andy Pettitte’s playbook late in his career, when the fellow lefty went year to year.

However it plays out, Sabathia has had an impressive second act.

Following two sensational starts against the Orioles in the 2012 ALDS, Sabathia was rocked for five earned runs and 11 hits in 3 ²/₃ innings by the Tigers in Game 4 of the ALCS in which the Yankees were swept.

From the start of 2013 until the end of the 2016 season, which was an improvement over the previous three years, Sabathia was 32-39 with a 4.54 ERA in 99 starts and developed a balky right knee that requires a brace when he pitches.

When healthy, Tanaka was the Yankees’ ace the past three years, but that is no longer the case. Pineda was too inconsistent to be a staff leader, and he has vanished from this year’s landscape. Luis Severino, an All-Star, still is navigating big league waters. Montgomery has 18 major league starts.

Two years ago Sabathia had to wait until the final days of spring training to find out if he was the fifth starter or headed to long relief. Now, he is one of the top reasons the Yankees are in the hunt to play in their first postseason series since 2012 and hoping to stay with a team that might need him more than he does them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0279663-71822837c5288716f6a793fc8262d6da.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011510 00000000000 014651  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Former Chief White House Correspondent and newly-minted CBS This Morning co-host Norah O’Donnell has been on fire lately, holding a veritable clinic on how to interview dishonest politicians that her mainstream media colleagues would do well to study. In the latest example of this, O’Donnell abandoned the current media fashion of ignoring lies (or presenting the truth as just another counter-argument), and pursued Sen. Rob Portman‘s (R-OH) disinformation on the recent violence in Libya like a Terminator with OCD.

What O’Donnell has been doing recently shouldn’t seem as remarkable as it is, but good old-fashioned feet to the fire followup is a sadly dying art, especially in television news. Interviewers either let lies and misinformation slip by because they need to hit all their prepared questions before time’s up, or because they’re numb to post-truth politics, or they present the facts in asterisk fashion before moving on to allow more lies to spew forth.

For O’Donnell, this is just an extension of the toughness she displayed as a White House reporter, but in her new role as morning show co-host, unprepared politicians like Sen. Rob Portman are in for a rude awakening.

Sen. Portman appeared on CBS This Morning Thursday morning to try and stanch the bleeding from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney‘s monumental foot self-strafing on the violence in Libya and Egypt.

Portman began with the lie that “(Gov. Romney’s) statement was made the night before we knew about the deaths of those four brave Americans in Libya. So, it was in relationship not to what happened in Libya but, of course, what happened in Egypt,” when, in fact, the Romney statement actually referenced the death of one American consulate worker in Libya. He went on to say that “The first statement that came out, and it says at its start, we apologize (note: nothing remotely similar to those words appears anywhere in the embassy statement). I think most Americans would look at that and say, gosh, that’s not the appropriate response when your embassy is assaulted, when the American flag is taken down, and two Islamic flags put up over American territory and lives were in jeopardy.”

O’Donnell confronted Sen. Portman with the fact that “the statement from the U.S. embassy in Cairo was issued before there were any attacks. They were issued because there was concern about protests,” then asked “Do you know that?”

“No,” Portman replied, “I was not aware it was issued before there were any attacks.”

Most people, at that point, would have reached for an ice cold can of Shut The F Up™, but Portman tried to close the loop by saying “I still think it implies that somehow these attacks could be justified by, again, a video that the U.S. government had nothing to do with, that came out in July and…”

At this point, if they’d challenged him at all, most mainstream interviewers would probably move on to the next question, but O’Donnell interjected “Senator, forgive me, but that is the point of this whole thing. As the President said, the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued that initial statement before these protests, and way before the attacks in Libya to try and cool things down. The attacks had not yet occurred. There was no apology that had taken place.”

Portman kept at it, saying that the embassy statement was “an apology for a video, again, that we had nothing to do with,” and explaining that “for Gov. Romney having seen that statement to react as he did is the reaction that most Americans would have, which is that, at a time when we have this kind of violence against American territory, the thing to do is to condemn it. Not to begin by issuing an apology, again, about video that had nothing to do with…

O’Donnell once again brought the truth down on Portman like the Hammer of Thor, cutting in and saying “Senator, there was no condemning the attacks had not occurred. When the attacks occurred, of course the administration came out and condemned that.”

Even after all of that, Portman repeated the lie once more, saying “I think you saw something that appeared to be inappropriate because it was talking about an apology before condemning the attacks and made a statement about it,” and just talked his way through to the end of the segment.

O’Donnell’s performance here should be in network news training videos, because the only way to get these people to stop lying is to put up a lie stop sign. For awhile, of course, every interview would look like this one, with the subject being stuck on the one lie for the whole interview, but eventually, they’d have to either start fessing up when they’re busted, or (heaven forbid) just start telling the truth.

Here’s the interview, from CBS This Morning:

Nay, angry is an understatement, I am livid. Anger wasn’t the only thing I felt yesterday. I was also deeply ashamed to be a citizen of a country where the story that Malek Maktabi’s show, in a rare instance of journalistic integrity, portrayed not only could happen, but is probably part of a bigger array of stories just waiting to be told.

The story, summarized, is as follows:

In 1991, Deepa Darmasiri was a Sri Lankan working as a housekeeper at a Lebanese household in the South. The husband in the household she was working in, whose name was always bleeped out and never mentioned, one day raped Deepa at knife-point, leading her to become pregnant. Deepa did not want to get an abortion because she “never could imagine not meeting her child.” So she carried the baby to term. To make his rape legal and to be able to register the baby, that scumbag of a man exercised his religiously given right to polygamy and married Deepa. Once Deepa gave birth, he took the baby girl whom he named Zainab – Deepa wanted to name her Huda – and got the mother deported back to her country, never to see or hear from her daughter ever again.

The story of a Lebanese daughter searching for her Sri Lankan mother is a heartbreaking reminder of how horrifying Lebanese patriarchy is. What’s worse is that Zainab is not a lone example of the disgusting state that our demented patriarchal laws have led us to.

Deepa is a victim on so many levels. She’s a victim for being a woman living in a country (and a world in the bigger sense) that sees her gender as inferior, both actually and legally. She’s a victim of Lebanese personal status law, placing her as inferior to her husband in all regards, even in the matter of him being able to divorce her as easily as he did, leading her to getting deported. She’s the victim of being from a nationality that we, as a country, deem as lesser. Because, you know, we as Lebanese are the creme de la creme and everyone else be damned.

Side note: Sri Lanka has better infrastructure than this dismal country currently has and will probably have for years to come. They have faster internet, 24/7 electricity, better water coverage and their women are more equal to men. But please, tell me more about how we think they’re inferior because they come work here in jobs we would never partake in, or because they’re black, or maybe because they’re not originally Phoenicians, or because any nationality that is not White and Western is one that we look down to thinking we are so much better.

News flash: we are not. Not even close. Deepa’s story shows how rotten to the core this country is.

Get this: we live in a country where a man was able to rape, impregnate, have the woman carry the child to term, take her baby away, have her deported NEVER to be able to come back again and still roam free.

Why? Because this is Lebanese patriarchy. This is how it works. Men are always superior. Lebanese are superior to non-Lebanese especially if those non-Lebanese don’t have a strong country to be able to defend them, and it’s just disgraceful. How is this man considered a human being, I wouldn’t know. He’s an abomination, pure and simple. Not only is that man still roaming free, never seeing a jail cell in his life for all the disgusting things he’s done, but he’s also probably protected by some politician down South that makes him impenetrable.

The disgraceful thing is that what he did was not illegal according to Lebanese law. He was perfectly within his rights as a man to do what he did to Deepa and to her daughter Zainab.

How horrifying is it that this man overpowered a helpless migrant worker, raped her, violated ALL her rights, her only fault being coming to this country to seek a better future for herself?

How horrifying is it that this man didn’t care in the least about his daughter, about the fact he brought her into this world as a result of raping a helpless woman after holding a knife to her throat?

How horrifying is it that Deepa had no one to run to, no one to help her, that our ministries of social affairs and labor wouldn’t have cared about her plight, about the fact she was violated that way?

Zainab and Deepa’s story is precisely why our laws need to be changed and I hope it provides the much needed catalyst for NGOs dealing with migrant workers to have a louder platform from which to proclaim their very rightful demands.

We cannot and should not be allowed to have an upper hand over workers who come from any country in the world just because they are coming to work here. We cannot and should not be allowed to have our men hold an upper hand over our women or any women wherever they come from, just because they happened to be born with a set of XY chromosomes.

We cannot and should not allow anyone to do what that scumbag did and still be allowed to roam free, unchecked and unpunished. As long as our laws allow them too, some men will do what this creature did, and others have probably done so plenty of times already. How many more Zainbas are out there because our state has enabled the perpetuation of this, because of our patriarchy and our sense that we are better than other “lesser” nationalities? It’s just disgraceful, and shameful.

What’s even more shameful are those who were bothered by this topic being discussed, under the pretext that it’s not New Year’s Eve material. Wake the hell up. This is a reality that is part of this wretched country every single day. You getting sad for a few seconds is upsetting you? You realizing this country’s laws are messed up to say the least is distressing you and ruining your party spirit? Deepa and her daughter Zainab never had any New Year Eves together because of the apathy of people like you.

42 days after she met her daughter, Deepa passed away probably from cancer. She couldn’t be flown to Lebanon to spend the remainder of her days with her daughter because getting a Lebanese visa to a Sri Lankan is near-impossible. This goes back again to our country thinking it’s better than others while our own citizens beg at the door of embassies for visas for other countries to seek out better futures.

I commend Malek Maktabi on his work with Zainab and Deepa’s story, and I sincerely hope this doesn’t stop at it being a NYE special to get viewers worked up. This should be as daily a conversation as possible, to hopefully reach a place where Lebanon’s state doesn’t perpetuate the existence of more Zainabs and more Deepas.

Deepa Darmasiri, rest in peace you beautiful gorgeous human being.                    0279676-f72e69f38ead3038a5b56da003d2982a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010131 00000000000 015124  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        CNN commentator and activist Sally Kohn took the lowest of the low roads today in an op-ed calling for more gun control. Kohn claims that CNN host Ashleigh Banfield made the claim that “10,000 children are killed by guns every year,” and so—of course—we need more gun laws.

Recently, my CNN colleague Mel Robbins made a startling point. Robbins was on “Legal View” to discuss the case of an 11-year-old who shot and killed an 8-year-old neighbor when host Ashleigh Banfield noted that 10,000 children are killed by guns every year. Robbins was taken aback by the statistic. Then Robbins pointed out that when the government found out that a certain type of crib resulted in 32 children dying over 10 years, what did the government do about the cribs? “Outlawed them,” she said. But 10,000 kids die because of guns every single year and we can’t pass even the most measly common sense safety laws?

You’ll note that Sally doesn’t provide a source for the claim that she attributes to Ashleigh, and that’s probably for the very good reason is that the claim is blatant propaganda.

Kohn is intentionally misquoting the headline of MSNBC article from last year, Nearly 10,000 American children are injured or killed by guns every year.

When you actually go to the MSNBC article, you’ll find that the story’s lede doesn’t come close to saying that 10,000 kids are killed by guns in a given year. It’s all a sleight of hand based on the study of a single year’s data.

Over 7,000 children are hospitalized or killed due to gun violence every year, according to a new study published in the medical journal Pediatrics. An additional 3,000 children die from gun injuries before making it to the hospital, bringing the total number of injured or killed adolescents to 10,000 each year.

So we have 3,00 fatalities that don’t make it to the hospital, but 7,000 “Hospitalized or killed?” What the heck does that even mean?

As anyone who watched the Princess Bride knows, there’s a huge difference between “all dead” and “mostly dead.”

If you go to the actual study in Pedatrics, you know what we find out?

The “mostly dead” were almost entirely alive. Of the 7,391 “children” who went to hospitals with gunshot wounds, just 453 died.

A review of hospital records found that firearms caused 7,391 hospitalizations among children younger than 20 during 2009, the most recent year for which records are available, said Dr. John Leventhal, lead study author. Of those shooting victims, 453 died while in the hospital. More than half of the gun injuries involved an attack on the child, but nearly one-third were unintentional, the investigators found. (Others were of undetermined causes or from suicide attempts.)

We’re not in any way making light of the 453 deaths, as each of these “children” was loved by someone who is diminished by their loss.

That said, Kohn’s claim has already dropped by roughly two-thirds, from 10,000 “children” to just 3,453.

Now, let’s very clear in noting how deceptive even this much-reduced figure really is.

Kohn lead with the anecdote of a suburban 11-year-old who shot and killed an 8-year-old neighbor, painting the picture of a completely random and senseless deaths of elementary school children.

That event was horrible… and made national news because of just how rare and unique it was.

In reality, it isn’t random suburban elementary school students shooting one another over puppies that is the problem.

The supermajority of those shot are black males, which are shot at a rate ten times higher than that of whites. 84-percent of those shot were boys 15-19 years old. Almost all were shot in intentional criminal attacks while involved in illicit activity, by other young black males who were involved in illicit activities.

Put bluntly, they are gang-bangers shooting other gang bangers.

Sally Kohn went out of her way to create the mental image of ten thousand innocent children being murdered every year by those evil guns.

In reality, under 3,500 people, mostly criminals 15-19 years of age, were gunning one another down in gang turf wars over drug territory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0279570-8b33ba44f6d2ecfd59a555c6b4521603.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005071 00000000000 015120  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Service > Grad School

I recently had dinner with a dear friend of mine and like many twentysomethings, she has been struggling to get out of the dead-end job rut. As she told me she wanted to attend grad school for administration, I gawked, “do you even like administration?” Her answer was a lack-luster, “well it is something.” I am all for expanding horizons and skill sets but at a cost of $70,000- that education better be worth more then “something.”

I asked her if she had considered participating in a year of service, and her response (typical of most young people I talk to) was “I need to make money to pay off student loan debt.”

This is a valid response, but it highlights the misconception that a year-long service commitment is equivalent to stuffing envelopes at the local church or serving soup at a soup kitchen (while still powerful acts of service, they are often temporary and less of a career-boosting experience than a year-long volunteer post).

While they do not pay well, long-term service opportunities often defer your student loan debt (AmeriCorps, PeaceCorps and Teach For America all do). These programs provide positions where the volunteer has an opportunity to be a leader without needing past experience to do so. In these roles, volunteers are empowered to take initiative, and in most cases they are given responsibilities similar to paid staff. Being a staff member within a non-profit organization requires wearing multiple hats, and can include everything from coordinating volunteer teams to managing a website, to training program directors- all of this being accomplished by one person! Consider this scenario: You are a mid-twenty something trying to discover your life calling. You are unsure of what to do with your current skill sets, and you have the desire to learn more- Why would you pay thousands of dollars to acquire “mastery” in a specific field if you are not sure that is the field that makes you come alive? Long-term service opportunities may not pay off monetarily, yet its value in experience is far greater, and will not put you in debt like years of grad school would. In fact, check out this initiative from the Brandeis University, offering a minimum of $10,000 in scholarship to Americorps Alumni!

Once my friend reoriented to service learning not as a high school graduation requirement, but instead as an actual means to discover her purpose, while building skills- she was then able to look at a year of service parallel to how she was looking at grad school-as an investment.

When you sit down to assemble a puzzle, even one with thousands of pieces, you at least have a photo of the completed image to work towards. But thanks to some clever mathematics, this Infinite Galaxy Puzzle can be assembled in any direction, or in any shape, leaving you without much guidance on how to put it together.

Based on a scientific curiosity called a Klein bottle, which is an impossible 3D shape whose insides and outsides are mathematically identical, the intricate pieces that make up this infinite puzzle can be transferred to its opposite side by simply flipping them over.

Usually when you start a puzzle you take a few minutes to flip every piece over so the artwork is visible on all of them. But that would be a waste of time here since both sides of this Infinite Galaxy Puzzle feature an image of the galactic center as taken by the Hubble observatory. In a way, there’s no wrong or right way to assemble the puzzle, which makes it more challenging to most, but downright maddening to puzzle purists.

If it sounds like a challenge you’re up to, the 133-piece, laser-cut, birch plywood Infinite Galaxy Puzzle is available from Nervous System for $100. It includes an image of our galaxy for reference, but it won’t make assembling the puzzle that much easier.

There’s also a cheaper version, called the Infinity Puzzle, which instead comes with 51 unfinished birch plywood pieces for $50 that you can use to create whatever abstract shapes you want since there’s no image to assemble.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279695-b11dacd80e19be496b8108a69a382066.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004274 00000000000 015055  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        I spend a lot of time building virtual networking tiers using VMware NSX, and so I wrote a few PowerShell scripts that automate the build and removal process and open sourced them on GitHub here. I’m by no means a wizard at this sort of thing, but I’ve tried to make the code as clean, commented, and error-handling friendly as I could within the past few rounds of commits.

The documentation is rather ugly, and there are more things I’d like to do with the project. If you were following Matt Brender’s really awesome Commitmas project, perhaps you’d consider floundering around GitHub with me and helping with the docs or features. 🙂

Requirements

PowerShell 4.0 , because I like the Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet.

A functional VMware NSX installation: manager, controllers, prepared cluster, and transport zone. View the Working with NSX posts if you’ve yet to do this part. Yes, I could automate this as well, but I rarely find myself standing up net-new installations when compared to standing up (and removing) virtual networks. Prioritization of my time. 🙂

Topology

The script builds a pretty standard switch > router > transit > edge topology, nothing all that fancy. Here’s a delightful Visio with some sample subnets added as examples.

Results

At the time of this post, the script will build the following components based on what you put into a json file (provided) that holds the configuration variables:

However many logical switches you desire.

A distributed logical router for the mentioned switches.

An edge services gateway.

A transit switch to bridge the router to the gateway.

Trimmings: Interface addresses, SSH access, dynamic routing with OSPF, etc.

Have fun!

According to the FTC’s complaint, the Florida-based CyberSpy Software, LLC marketed and sold RemoteSpy keylogger spyware to clients who would then secretly monitor unsuspecting consumers’ computers. The FTC seeks to permanently bar the unfair and deceptive practices and require the defendants to give up their ill-gotten gains.

According to papers filed with the court, the defendants provided RemoteSpy clients with detailed instructions explaining how to disguise the spyware as an innocuous file, such as a photo, attached to an email. When consumer victims clicked on the disguised file, the keylogger spyware silently installed in the background without the victims’ knowledge. This spyware recorded every keystroke typed on the victim’s computer (including passwords); captured images of the computer screen; and recorded Web sites visited. To access the information gathered and organized by the spyware, RemoteSpy clients would log into a Web site maintained by the defendants.

Defendants touted RemoteSpy as a “100% undetectable” way to “Spy on Anyone. From Anywhere.” According to the FTC complaint, the defendants violated the FTC Act by engaging in the unfair advertising and selling of software that could be: (1) deployed remotely by someone other than the owner or authorized user of a computer; (2) installed without the knowledge and consent of the owner or authorized user; and (3) used to surreptitiously collect and disclose personal information. The FTC complaint also alleges that the defendants unfairly collected and stored the personal information gathered by their spyware on their own servers and disclosed it to their clients. The complaint further alleges that the defendants provided their clients with the means and instrumentalities to unfairly deploy and install keylogger spyware and to deceive consumer victims into downloading the spyware.

On November 5, 2008, the FTC filed its complaint and requested a temporary restraining order against the defendants from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division. Under the terms of the order approved by the court, in addition to halting the sale of their RemoteSpy software, the defendants must disconnect from the Internet any of their servers that collect, store, or provide access to information that this software has gathered.

The complaint also names Tracer R. Spence – the registered agent and manager of the

Orlando, Florida-based CyberSpy Software – as liable and culpable for the charges made in this case. The Commission vote authorizing the staff to file the complaint and request a temporary restraining order was 4-0.

A complaint filed by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”) brought the RemoteSpy software to the FTC’s attention.

NOTE: The Commission authorizes the filing of a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest. A complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have actually violated the law.

Not a progressive champion.

Charles Johnson at Little Green Footballs posted a tweet from Wikileaks that tells you everything you need to know about their intentions:

This is not the tweet of a liberal group only interested in transparency; this is a tweet by a highly partisan player with a very specific agenda. Said agenda, of course, being the downfall of the evil American empire no matter who gets hurt in the process.

This is not progressive in the slightest.

Back in 2009-2010, the ostensibly liberal Jane Hamsher of the now defunct FireDogLake website went full scorched earth against Obama and his signature legislation, Obamacare. She did this because it wasn't a single payer system and therefore was a betrayal of all that is liberal and good in the world.

Hamsher went so off the rails that she started working with Tea Party Republicans to scrap the bill. Obamacare isn't perfect but it got over 20 million people health insurance, many of them for the first time. But because it didn't live up to Hamsher's standards, she wanted it destroyed.

And so it always is these days with the far left. Assange and his group are their heroes because they're out to take down The Man, maaaaannnn! Overthrow the corrupt system, burn it all down and a magical liberal utopia will take its place. Sure, there's no historical precedent for that but that doesn't matter!

Curiously, the far left always seems to be comprised of the beneficiaries of the system they despise so much: white, middle class and insulated from the deleterious effects of the anarchy they so desperately long for. It's almost like they consider their struggles to be far more important than the struggles of the black, Latino and LGBT communities.

These are the children who think "President" Trump would be great because he would make the rotten system crash and then....freedom! Sure, millions would suffer and tens of thousands (or more) would die but that's a small price for other people to pay.

Assange is even worse because he wants this chaos on a global level. Millions would die and countries like Russia would run rampant over Eastern Europe, but Assange, all safe and snuggled in his Ecuadorian Fortress of Scummitude, could care less about that.

The Far Left is, at last, all but indistinguishable from the Far Right. Destruction for the sake of destruction is not a progressive ideal and it never has been. Serving the greater good means you are willing to sacrifice your own priorities to advance those of your allies. Throwing them under the bus to get what you want is how conservatives think and any progressive that subscribes to this philosophy has forgotten the "We" in "WE the people".                                                                                                                                                                          0279678-f2117f03ee87899e662e23dc5862e7b9.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005447 00000000000 015040  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        DHARAMSALA, India — After more than 100 Tibetans have set themselves on fire, a man who tried and failed says he won’t do it again — but only because he doesn’t want to create trouble for the Dalai Lama.

“I won’t try to burn myself again,” said the 30-year-old survivor Dawa Dhondup, a shy and soft-spoken man in Dharamsala, the Himalayan seat of the Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile in northern India.

Dhondup drank kerosene and poured it all over his body before hundreds of Tibetans at a March 10 procession here to mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. As he was about to light a match, fellow Tibetans and police overpowered him.

He has spent the last month undergoing treatment for the kerosene poisoning, and recently started a job as a cook at a Tibetan school.

Dhondup said he wanted to show solidarity with the 115 Tibetans who have self-immolated inside Tibet to protest Chinese rule and call for restoration of freedom and the return of the Dalai Lama.

While he doesn’t regret his actions, he regrets any headaches he caused for the Dalai Lama in his adopted home city. It was the first time a Tibetan had tried to self-immolate near the Dalai Lama’s headquarters.

Local police charged Dhondup with attempted suicide, and warned local Tibetans they could face restrictions if they tried to demonstrate on his behalf or otherwise cause trouble. A local Tibetan Youth Congress leader, Tenzin Tsundue, gave a written promise that no Tibetans in Dharamsala would attempt a similar act.

The attempted suicide raised concerns with the Indian government because China has accused the Dalai Lama of inciting monks and nuns inside Tibet to set themselves ablaze. New Delhi often uses the presence of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile as leverage with China, but generally avoids provoking the ire of Beijing.

Dhondup, who walked for five days from his home in southern Tibet to India at age 18, said he was deeply disturbed by the criticism that the recent spate of self-immolations have failed to bring change in China’s Tibet policy.

“I wanted the world to know Tibetans in Tibet are not alone in their suffering,” he said.

A Buddhist and believer in reincarnation, Dhondup said he didn’t know what consequences his action would yield in his next life. “Since I’m not educated, I had no other way to contribute; that’s all I thought of.”

He added that he wasn’t afraid of a painful death, nor was he devoid of hope.

“I believe Tibet will be free during my lifetime because of the Dalai Lama’s leadership,” he said. “But there’s no freedom in Tibet right now, and I wanted to do something about it. I won’t repeat it though.”

The long Heat season is over, which means no more confusing conversations with Chris Andersen.

Andersen skipped the voluntary media access at the team’s year-end meetings last week, but he did speak prior to the game in Philadelphia a few days beforehand. That will suffice as the State of the Birdman address.



Most discussions with Andersen get off track eventually. This one got off track immediately:

What was it like dealing with the injury trouble you guys had this year?

“Who said we had trouble?”

You had injury trouble.

“We had injuries, but we didn’t have trouble.”

So that would be injury trouble.

“Yeah.”

It was a lot of instability to deal with.

“Up and down, side to side, like my ’67 truck. Know what I’m saying?”

No, of course not.

“Front, back, side to side. That’s what it’s like.”

Ok.

“It’s a Chevy. C-10.”

So the season was like a ’67 Chevy?

“My ’67 Chevy.”

So you gotta get the transmission rebuilt?

“No. It’s just front, back, side to side.”

This seems like a metaphor, but I don’t follow it.

“Well you don’t have air ride on your truck, do you?”

Probably not. I drive a Toyota Camry.

“There you go.”

Ok.

“Well.”

Seriously though, the original question.

“Y’all ask me questions and I’m gonna give you the answer. That’s the answer.”

How much did it test you guys having players in and out all the time?

“We were tested a lot, like a college student. We were tested all the time.”

How’d you hold up health-wise?

“I feel great.”

I doubt that.

“I do. I feel great.”

What are you doing this summer?

“None of your business. You can follow me on my Instagrams and you’ll know what I’m doing this summer.”

Do you need surgery this offseason?

“Do I need surgery? I’m not looking to get any kind of surgery. No surgeries.”

Do you feel good about the group coming back next year?

“All the guys are healthy? Yes. I think we will be in a better position.”

Is that enough to compete?

“That’s a good question. There is gonna be a lot of assessing, but we’ll just have to figure that out.”

How much do you have left at this point in your career?

“I’ve got about 12 dollars left in my pocket because of Chick-fil-A, but I can go to the ATM any time and withdraw a limit of $300.”

Ok, but you played at 36 or 37 years old (36, actually) this year. How much do you have left?

“Man, you are terrible with numbers. I can withdraw from the ATM $300. I don’t know where you get 36, 37.”

How do you feel about the way the season went for you?

“I feel that our season was just, like just, too many injuries.”

But you personally. How did you feel about your season?

“My season?”

Yes. You had an ankle injury, a calf injury–

“I got kicked in the calf, man, and then some guy landed on both my ankles and just twisted them. So yeah, man, it’s a physical game. That’s what this is. It’s a physical game. Contact sport.”

How’d you feel about the way you held up physically?

“Why you keep trying to dig into my emotions, man? I’m a man. I don’t talk about my feelings.”

No, how do you feel physically?

“Oh, physical?”

Yeah. I’m not interested in your emotional feelings.

“Good, because I don’t talk about my feelings at all.”

Right. Save that for therapy.

“I don’t do therapy. I’m gonna go talk to somebody?”

I mean that another person would. Not you, obviously.

“I wouldn’t. I would hire someone to go talk for me.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    0279532-c7e4c5a762f9e611dfc85c80a5816c47.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005716 00000000000 015146  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The government is guilty of a “dereliction of duty” in failing to look at what would happen to Trident if Scotland votes for independence, a former first sea lord has said.

Lord West of Spithead warned the ability of the rest of the UK to defend itself would be “dramatically reduced” if the Scots voted to quit the Union.

Former secretary of state for Scotland Lord Forsyth of Drumlean said a vote for independence would in effect mean the end of the UK’s nuclear deterrent.

The submarines carrying the UK’s Trident nuclear warheads operate from the Faslane naval base on the Clyde and there are potential problems with finding a suitable alternative location in England.

At question time in the House of Lords, defence minister Lord Astor of Hever told peers: “We are confident the Scottish people will vote to remain part of the United Kingdom, therefore we are not making any contingency plans for a Yes vote.”

But Labour’s Lord West, a former security minister, said: “It does seem that it is a dereliction of duty not to be looking at alternatives on such an important issue.

“We all know that actually our ability to defend our islands should Scotland separate is going to be dramatically reduced.

“We know whatever happens should they separate there will be huge costs to our defence budget.”

He said the “real special relationship” with the United States was based on a “nuclear and intelligence relationship”.

Tory Lord Forsyth asked: “Why is the government prepared to anticipate what the effects on Scottish independence would be on the currency, but not on our national security and our defence policy given the threat this represents to the independent nuclear deterrent?

“Isn’t the truth of the matter that if [First Minister] Alex Salmond achieves his nuclear-free Scotland, the practical consequences will mean the end of the British nuclear deterrent at a time of great economic and geo-political uncertainty. Does the government have a Plan B?”

Lord Astor said moving the deterrent and its facilities would be an “enormous exercise”.

He told peers: “Our nuclear deterrent is the ultimate safeguard of our national security and we have made a clear commitment to maintain that. There is absolutely no question that the UK will unilaterally disarm.”

He added: “To start planning now for a United Kingdom without Scotland would start to unpick the fabric of the UK before the people of Scotland have had their say and would require UK government ministers to prioritise the interests of one part of the United Kingdom over those of others.”

He said a vote to leave the UK would mark the start of a “lengthy and complex” process of negotiations.

Labour’s Lord Desai asked: “Would it be charitable to believe that the government, as a responsible agency, may have scenarios up its sleeve but you are not willing to take the House into confidence?”

Lord Astor replied: “Even if I did know that I couldn’t possibly comment.”                                                  0279682-7cca866690d8eb1a93e727cb2dfdce3b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000005260 00000000000 015440  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        In fact, a 2010 Rand Survey found that a whopping 87% of Iranians surveyed strongly favored the "development of nuclear energy for civilian use" and 97% believed nuclear energy to be a national right. This helps the Iranian government to portray Western efforts to curtail the program as an assault on the Iranian public's rights. Interestingly, although the number of people who support the development of nuclear weapons is much lower -- 32% -- it is still considerable.

However, a much more recent poll, from just one month ago shows that most Iranians polled still approved of a civilian nuclear program, but by a significantly narrower margin. Only 57% of respondents say they supported the program, a decrease of 30%. And that's not the only interesting number. In the 2010 Rand poll, no one refused to answer the question and only 2% claimed they didn't know. In Gallup's most recent poll, the number of people who refuse to answer or say they don't know goes up to almost a quarter of those polled. Finally, the number of people who say they support the development of "nuclear power capabilities for military use" is still significant; 40% of those polled.

The change in polls numbers, assuming they're accurate, indicates three things about Iranian public opinion. There seems to have been a significant drop in Iranian support for a nuclear energy program, more Iranians are aware of how sensitive the issue is (which may explain why so many more people chose not to answer), and less than half of those polled are in favour of developing a nuclear weapon.

Times have changed. Today's Iran is one marred by internal problems, from the power struggle between Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to the tightly controlled parliamentary elections to the worsening economic strains on the daily lives of Iranians. Official figures put inflation at 21.6% and unemployment at 11.8%, although independent economists estimate that it is much higher. The Iranian currency, following the latest sanctions on Iran's Central Bank and its oil exports, has lost over 50% of its value, making trade riskier and more expensive for Iranians.

Naturally, public attention has shifted to daily problems. Many Iranians now consider pursuit of the nuclear program as too costly.

As Iranians continue to face economic sanctions and tough talk from abroad as well as economic and political turmoil at home, their support for a nuclear program will likely continue to drop. The interesting question is whether or not this changing opinion will trickle up into the regime itself.

The nuclear program is still closely tied to national pride in Iran, but the decreasing support for it could present two possible opportunities for the West.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0279665-21202b1070b1b6f3e7483c1631ae477b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000021270 00000000000 014657  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Courier-Mail Pleads Guilty in Case of Abducted Italian Girls

August 28, 2013 by Robert Franklin, Esq.

As an old song once said, “it’s a sign of the times.” Surely this story gives us some idea of the misplaced values and downright strangeness of the times we live in (Brisbane Times, 8/23/13). It’s yet another in the seemingly endless consequences of an Australian mother’s abduction of her four daughters from Italy four years ago. I’ve written about the case many times and will again, if what I’m hearing lately comes to light. But more of that as events in the case unfold as they continue to do.

The most recent item tells us that a Murdoch-owned (who else?) newspaper, the Courier-Mail, has pleaded guilty to four violations of the Family Law Act. The tabloid admits guilt because it published the photographs and the names of the four girls. That’s forbidden by the Act and, although I personally disagree with the secrecy with which the law enshrouds family matters, the law is the law and the Courier-Mail plainly broke it. I promise you I’m not losing sleep over any hardships visited on Rupert Murdoch.

No, what interests me is that the paper’s publication of the girls’ names and photographs is the single instance of wrongdoing Australian authorities seem to think has occurred in the case. At least it’s the only violation anyone’s been held accountable for, and therein lies the cause of my astonishment.

You remember the case of the four girls. Their mother, Laura Garrett, abducted them from the only country they’d ever lived in — Italy — and took them to Australia, directly contravening the rights of their Italian father, Tommaso Vincenti. That’s a violation of numerous laws of Italy, Australia and of international treaties. Was she punished? No. In fact, Australian courts went out of their way to reward her behavior. As but one extreme example, Australian authorities refused to allow Vincenti to have custody of his children and return them to Italy until the Italian police agreed to not prosecute Garrett for her crime. That’s pretty special treatment for anyone, much less an apparent felon.

Then of course there are Garrett’s mother, grandmother and aunts. Once Australian courts had ascertained that all Garrett’s claims about abuse by Vincenti were false and that she’d violated international law, they determined to return the children to Italy. And, lo and behold, the girls vanished, and supposedly no one knew where they’d gone. Of course Garrett’s maternal relatives knew perfectly well where they were because they were the ones who’d sequestered them. They then gilded the lily by lying to the police and courts about their frank violation of the court’s order. Were they punished in any way? No.

What about Garrett’s parental alienation of the girls? During their almost three years in Australia the kids went from speaking lovingly of their father and wishing to see and be with him, to loathing the very thought of him. That was all on public display as they had to be literally dragged kicking and screaming to the airplanes that were to take them back to Italy. Parental alienation is child abuse, but did anyone suggest that Garrett’s parental rights should be limited due to either her abduction of the children or her alienation of them? No.

For that matter, what about the behavior of the Australian Embassy staff in Rome? Documents recovered by more than one media source make it pretty clear that those employees of the Australian government knowingly colluded with Garrett in her abduction of the girls. They not only ignored the usual protocols that include verifying Garrett’s claims of abuse and the voluntariness of Vincenti’s agreement to allow them to go in the first place, but even took part in altering Garrett’s travel plans in order to fool Vincenti into thinking they intended to return. Has anyone in the embassy been held to account for conspiring with Garrett to violate the law and deny Vincenti access to his children and they to him? No.

Libel, slander, defamation of character? For years now, Garrett and her various female relatives have called Vincenti an abuser despite there being not a shred of evidence for the proposition. They did so in court and out, for the sole purpose of depriving him of his children and they of their father. Have they paid a price for their plainly wrongful conduct? No.

Perjury? See above. Garrett claimed under oath that Vincenti abused her and the children, but produced no evidence of it and her allegations are in fact false. Has she been held accountable or even charged? No.

Indeed, from the minute Laura Garrett began hatching her plot to kidnap her children, there has been wrongdoing by multiple parties and Australian authorities seem to be fine with all of it. But when photographs of four girls are printed in the paper along with their names, alarm bells sound and the police come running.

And, speaking of the press, where were authorities in the early days of the scandal when newspapers and television alike vied with each other to present Tommaso Vincenti as exactly what Laura Garrett claimed — a vicious abuser? They were nowhere to be found. Again, when it comes to publishing factual information about the girls, not a letter of the law can be violated. But uncritically repeating lies about an innocent and loving father raised nary an eyebrow.

For months, the Australian press portrayed Vincenti as a heartless and cruel abuser. Just to make sure they couldn’t receive any evidence that contradicted that false narrative, not a single reporter picked up the telephone and contacted Vincenti to get his side of things. As we see so often in other parts of the world, the Australian news media prefer their fathers voiceless. Mothers? That’s a different story. As surely as they muzzled Vincenti, they gave Garrett her own stage and microphone. Finally, Vincenti managed to get his written statement partially covered by the press.

The father saw his children three times last week and released a statement on Thursday hitting out at the “negative description of me [which] has been presented unilaterally, untruthfully and knowingly distorted by the media. “As a result I now feel the urgent need to state that I am a father completely different from that which has been published and repeated about me. “The Italian courts and any other justice system are aware that I am a model father. No evidence has been presented to any courts which supports the unfounded and incorrect allegations made against me.”

Oh, that. Who knew that journalists are supposed to get their facts straight? Who’d have guessed that getting the other side of the story is something that’s supposed to be second nature to the press? You couldn’t tell it by the coverage accorded Vincenti and the kidnapping of his children.

So what have been the consequences to the members of the press who violated every elementary rule of their profession in order to trash one man’s reputation and promote the criminal and civil wrongdoing of his former wife? None whatsoever. Has anyone been fired, demoted? No. For that matter, has the management of those publications even noticed the outrageous pro-mother/anti-father bias that drenched every article on the case for months? If they have, it’s only been privately.

So yes, I suppose the Courier-Mail did wrong when it published the forbidden facts, but at least they were facts. So much of the rest of the early coverage was the fictional narrative of a criminal, Laura Garrett, bent on avoiding accountability for her many legal violations. I see a certain irony in punishing the former but not the latter.

It’s a sign of the times. The most heinous deprivation of parental rights, the violation of many criminal and civil laws, perjury, child abuse by a mother and libelous coverage by the press, all are given a pass. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along. But by far the least serious infraction of law by the Courier-Mail brings swift retribution. It’d be amazing if it weren’t so common.

In upcoming weekly recaps, my Variety colleagues and I will attempt to delve into all the ways in which this deeply conventional show throws convention out the window, sets it on fire, rebuilds it and then throws a dance party next it, in ways that make the viewer cry and gape and glory in being alive.

An excerpt from the notes I took while watching seven of the third and final season’s eight episodes: “I don’t understand anything, and it’s awesome.”

But first, before a few non-spoilery riffs on the show’s almost hilariously potent mixture of pain, disjunction, poetry and celebration, I need to share some thoughts about a purse. There is a point to this, I promise.

About three and a half years ago, I saw the purse in a photograph, on the arm of an actress you’ve heard of. I was looking at my favorite fashion and pop-culture site, as I do when I need a break. The actress accessorized well that day, and that should have been that.

It was not.

I needed that purse.

It was a designer purse, and it cost more than any normal human being should pay for a purse. Perhaps there are people out there who have shelled out four figures for a handbag, but I have never been one of those people, and had no intention of becoming one. I did not have that kind of money to spend on a purse.

And yet I had to have it.

I poked around the designer’s site, where it was sold out. I went on luxury web sites and set up alerts, hoping it would magically be restocked. I spent hours on eBay. No luck.

This entire time, whenever I thought about the purse, the rational part of my brain kept up a caustic commentary: “This is ridiculous. You have no need for an outrageously expensive bag that will live in your closet for the rest of your days because you’ll be ashamed to even think about how much you paid for it — and that’s if you find it. Stop wasting time on this!”

I kept looking. Because my father had just died, and I needed it. The purse would fix everything.

In the months after my father’s death, I never tipped over into shopaholic territory, but I now understand how it happens. It’s irrational — this idea that a purse or anything else will fix a problem, can paper over the hole in the heart, even temporarily. But these obsessions are so tempting not in spite of their irrationality, but because of it.

In grief, I wanted an escape, and my obsession with a purse granted me that.

This is why the characters of “The Leftovers” are my people.

They are sane and not quite sane. They have been marked by something deep and strange that they cannot name. They can’t always trust their instincts and even their sensory impressions. They know what it is to feel lost. In the riptide of grief and turmoil, some of these men and women have found something — an explanation, a belief, a person who says the right thing. It doesn’t matter if others think their belief — or their ritual, or their guru — is worthwhile. It grants them a small measure of comfort.

“The Leftovers” is funny, and sometimes that gets lost in the shuffle. But it’s often amusing because we are irrational creatures who have a spectacular ability to resist teachable moments. We all want, on some level, a little bit of fake news that makes us feel better, something that helps us tune out the hard stuff, the pain, the unanswerable questions, the unsolvable equations. We want to believe things that feel true (“A purse will fix things”) rather than things that are true (“People die and it hurts and you don’t get to be in control”).

The core achievement of “The Leftovers” — aside from crafting triumphantly coherent and delightfully bizarre episodes of television that boast beginnings, middles and endings and twists that feel both bananas and totally right — is that it celebrates our desire to ascribe meanings to things. The show sees very clearly how often we elide and edit the truth in our pursuit of some kind of coherent narrative about the losses we’ve suffered and the connections we cherish, but it’s not cruel about our myopia.

“The Leftovers” is essential viewing because it understands that popular culture and organized religion are both collections of attempts to find meaning, patterns, community, and coherence in a frighteningly random universe, which is why we fight over series finales and sacred texts with such vehemence. These battles mean so much to us because they tell us who we are. We have to tell ourselves something about what it all means, and the characters of “The Leftovers” are not only real and palpably textured and beautifully, realistically flawed, they — like the show— reject nihilism. Because nihilism is too easy, and, of course, it’s just another story.

Almost all of the characters on “The Leftovers” have obsessions or beliefs that mean a lot to them, and as the intensity gradually — or suddenly — ramps up this season, those beliefs collide in operatic ways. Sometimes it’s chamber opera, sometimes it’s folk music, sometimes it’s a rave, sometimes it’s grand opera mixed with a whispered ballad, and the suspense that comes from never knowing which it’ll be gives the entire enterprise a rumbling, delicious tension. Much of the action moves to the wide open spaces of rural Australia — the only place, aside from Texas, that feels big enough to contain the characters’ monomanias, their damaged and lovely connections, and their obsessive dreams.

There are fires, floods, bearded dudes, prophetic women and wanderings in the desert. There are needle drops that will make your heart skip with glee. There are farcical encounters on a boat, and Kevin Garvey is inundated with water so, so, so many times. You won’t be bored.

In the hands of other, less nimble creators of Prestige TV, the thematic core of “The Leftovers” — that we are lost and alone and we can never give up the habit of ascribing meanings to things we can’t fully understand and that this inability to give up on the divinity of narrative might be the definition of love — could be ponderous. A big, old slumbering bore.

But this miraculous series masterfully holds ambiguity and extremely robust storytelling in the same generous bear hug. How do you sum up a show that takes you on a rocketship ride of fear, love, pain and adrenaline, and makes a bunch of left turns and big swings, all in pursuit of reassuring itself, and us, that it’s OK that we don’t know anything, and connection is possible despite the fact that we’re all just a bunch of hopeless goofballs who are continually distracted by the wrong things?

I dunno.

I never did find the purse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279711-050c910d5d512062a1abe5ee75932a4a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000013142 00000000000 015006  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        

Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook and author of “Lean In.” (Jean-Christophe Bott — AP)

This post has been updated to include a response from a spokeswoman for LeanIn.Org.

When Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg released her girl-power tome, Lean In, she faced a barrage of criticism. Some argued that her perspective about the challenges facing working mothers, was severely limited because of Sandberg’s position as a highly educated, very rich, white woman, who will never know what it’s like to face the choice between taking a day off to stay home with a sick child, or risk losing the minimum wage job you need to buy that sick child’s medicine. To her credit, Sandberg acknowledged that her advice would not necessarily help every woman struggling to find her way, but it might help some like her – educated, white-collar professionals – find theirs.

Her defenders argued that the dismissal of Sandberg as an out of touch elitist was not entirely fair, and certainly didn’t render her larger point moot. But if Sandberg and her posse of Lean In-ers were hoping to shake their image as yet another unofficial professional sorority for privileged women, her team is certainly doing her no favors this week. Recently someone working for LeanIn.Org, the non-profit established by Sandberg to build on the goals outlined in her book, announced on Facebook (where else?) that the group is seeking unpaid interns.

Now a nonprofit seeking unpaid interns is not especially surprising. A nonprofit founded by a multimillionaire who is seeking unpaid labor is. Particularly when said multimillionaire earned more than $90 million in a stock sale shortly before her organization began asking for unpaid help.

Wednesday night Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for LeanIn.Org provided the following statement to She The People: “LeanIn.Org, like many nonprofits, has enjoyed the participation of some part-time volunteers to help us advance our education and peer support programs.” She also directed our attention to a Facebook Status update in which Jessica Bennett, who shared the initial posting seeking an unpaid intern wrote: “Want to clarify previous Lean In post. This was MY post, on MY feed, looking for a volunteer to help me in New York. LOTS of nonprofits accept volunteers. This was NOT an official Lean In job posting. Let’s all take a deep breath.” Saul confirmed, however, that Bennett is a LeanIn.Org staff member. Saul declined to comment on whether there are eventual plans to compensate anyone volunteering their services to aid the organization now or in the future or if there will ever be any paid internship opportunities with the group.

There are those who genuinely dislike the wealthy, or at the very least are suspicious of them. I am not one of them. But I do question someone who proclaims to want to see greater equality in the workplace, then promotes a practice that is inherently unequal. Unpaid internships reward those who can afford to work — often full-time, no less — for free. Who can afford to do that? Privileged people, that’s who. People like Ms. Sandberg, whose father was a doctor, and people like her children, whose parents are multimillionaires.

Over the last decade unpaid internships have become an American institution, seeping into virtually every profession, and increasingly pricing out poor and even middle class kids. The professions in which unpaid internships are most prevalent—media, fashion, the arts—are not surprisingly the least diverse.

Think I’m exaggerating about the fact that internships have increasingly become a luxury good of the privileged, right up there with a Birkin bag? Well, consider this: Fashion houses such as Valentino actually auction off unpaid internships at charity events for five figures. That’s right. Not only are kids not being paid to work, but their parents are paying for the privilege. That is, of course, if their families can afford to do so.

In recent years, more unpaid interns have begun to seek legal counsel. Earlier this year a judge ruled that two interns who worked on the Academy Award-winning film The Black Swan, deserved to be compensated for their work. Former unpaid interns for Conde Nast, the magazine empire, are following suit.

In 2010 the Department of Labor said it would begin cracking down on those attempting to use unpaid internships as a clever way of skirting minimum wage and other labor laws. While lawsuits may help, and federal oversight is important, they may not be the most effective ways of solving the internship crisis.

There will always be organizations, particularly nonprofits, that need help and can’t afford to compensate every single person. But most organizations have a supporter who can afford to compensate those who help in some way, whether it is a highly compensated executive allocating a few hundred dollars of his or her pay, or a wealthy board member earmarking a donation specifically for interns.

In my own experience, I had an internship in college that I could not have afforded to take had the staff not decided among themselves to set aside money for a stipend for me. Had they not done that, I could not have worked there — and I wonder how differently my career would have turned out.

Sheryl Sandberg certainly has the resources to change a young person’s life, the way those where I interned changed mine. If only she had the conscience and consciousness to do so. It seems she still doesn’t get that, for most Americans, “leaning in” is the least of our problems. Getting a foot in the door is.

George Alvarez sought compensation for damages he suffered from the Brownsville Police Department after he served four years of eight-year sentence for a conviction of which he was later found innocent.

Alvarez’s civil rights violation trial began on Monday with the jury issuing its verdict against the city on Tuesday. The case was being tried before senior U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle.

The lawsuit names the city of Brownsville, former police chief Carlos Garcia, jailer Jesus Arias, Sgt. David Infante, Lt. Henry Etheridge, and former Cmdr. Robert Avita as defendants.

Alvarez, who was 17 on Nov. 27, 2005 — the date of the assault — was arrested for suspicion of burglary of a motor vehicle and detained in the Brownsville city jail.

Alvarez alleges that during his time in the city jail, he was the victim of misconduct on behalf of jailer Jesus Arias after he became frustrated with the telephone located in his jail cell. The telephone was out of order and Alvarez began banging the phone against the wall.

Court records state that due to this behavior Arias took Alvarez out of the jail cell to relocate him in another cell without a telephone.

At this time, three jailers, including Arias, went into the cell to remove Alvarez and when he attempted to ask a question to the jailers, Arias lunged at Alvarez from behind, seized him by the neck and placed him in an illegal choke hold, court records show.

Court records show that Arias claimed that Alvarez had assaulted him while in jail custody and that reports filed by the BPD only obtained accounts from the jailers and not from Alvarez.

According to the documents, Alvarez pleaded guilty to the charges fearing that his word would never be taken against that of an officer. Alvarez was first sentenced to probation at the Substance Abuse Felony Punishment Facility for six months but he was unable to carry out the sentence. Alvarez was then sentenced to state prison for eight years, and he served four years before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals cleared him of the charges.

On Tuesday, Tagle ruled that the BPD violated Alvarez’s constitutional rights by failing to disclose video evidence in Alvarez’s case.

The footage was used to exonerate Alvarez of his conviction and provided evidence he was the victim of an assault with excessive force from BPD jailers.

The lawsuit against the BPD alleges that the officers were on the wrong side of the law when they allegedly falsified official reports, court records said.

Alvarez’s attorney Eddie Lucio said he was pleased by the jury’s decision.

“We hope this sends a message to the Brownsville Police Department. You can’t play games or hide evidence,” Lucio said.

The video documenting Alvarez’s incident at the city jail was discovered after another detainee, Joe Lopez, 60, was charged in 2006 with the same accusations, again by jailer Jesus Arias.

Court records show Lopez was determined to prove his innocence against the accusations and proceeded with a jury trial. During Lopez’s criminal trial, one of the attorneys involved in the case noted that a report of the incident was mentioned in the computer monitor, prompting attorneys to question jailers about any potential recordings. The BPD responded by providing attorneys with the video recording of Lopez’s incident.

According to police records, statements by the jailers implicated Lopez as the aggressor, but the video evidence proved otherwise. Jurors submitted a verdict of “not guilty,” clearing Lopez of any charges.

Lopez also filed a lawsuit against the BPD for withholding evidence and using excessive force resulting in an order by the federal court for the BPD to produce documents in response to Lopez’s suit. Court records show that Lopez’s attorney discovered the video evidence related to Alvarez’s case and revealed its exculpatory content.

Lucio said the victims of abuse by the BPD are the community’s most vulnerable.

“When situations like these happen, it happens to the young, the old and the poor, people who cannot defend themselves,” Lucio said.

“It’s not what we wanted,” Txiki Begiristain admitted. Manchester City’s director of football was in Zurich for the Champions League draw, where he could not get a reception on his phone. There was no way of telling his manager the news: “Pep, we’re going back.” But by the time he realised, Guardiola was surely already aware and he probably always suspected as much anyway. On the morning of the draw back in Catalonia some of those closest to him had already predicted this; it was, they had said, inevitable.

This is nothing new, for Begiristain or for Guardiola. This will be the third time City have been to the Camp Nou in four seasons. The last time they were there, so was Guardiola. He was not yet City’s manager but he was still a Barcelona soci: up in the stand, he hid his face behind a scarf, delighting in the disbelief as LionelMessi nutmegged James Milner. A few weeks later he was back again as Bayern Munich manager, his reaction down on the touchline rather different as Messi snapped Jérôme Boateng’s hips in half.

His first time as an opponent at the Camp Nou Guardiola admitted that was “not a normal game” and rightly predicted: “No one can stop Messi.” Now he must try again. Because he has been back once this game will be rather more low-key than that one but, as one member of staff at Barcelona’s San Joan Despí training ground put it this week: “It’s always a bit special when Pep comes.”

This is not just Guardiola and Begiristain, though; it is Ferran Soriano too, the former Barcelona vice-president. “It’ll be emotional. We have a lot of friends there,” Begiristain said. Most of them are anonymous members of staff, the connections multiple, shared friends and philosophies. There is something about City that means they just cannot avoid Barcelona, the club in whose image they are partly built.

Denis Suárez joined Manchester City at 17; now he is at Barcelona. Nolito joined Barcelona at 22; now he is at City. By his own admission his career owes most to two men who have coached him in two different teams, former team-mates who will occupy the touchline on Wednesday: Guardiola and Luis Enrique. This summer both wanted him. He chose City, just as Claudio Bravo did – Barcelona’s player on the morning of the draw, Barcelona’s opponent by the afternoon.

Bravo’s experience and the debate surrounding him reveals some of the shared ideas at the two clubs, fully embraced with the arrival of Guardiola at the Etihad – City’s revolution, if that is what it is to be, had felt a little unfinished until now; his arrival has been sought since the start.

Guardiola wanted Bravo (or, indeed, Marc-André ter Stegen) for much the same reason that Luis Enrique had wanted him: because, as well as being a goalkeeper who makes saves, he is a goalkeeper who makes his team play, just as Víctor Valdés was. Guardiola has explained the reasons but the debate continues and, for all that the concept has been more internalised in Catalonia, it is echoed on the other side of this game – now more than ever before.

Lionel Messi returns to his breathtaking best in Barcelona victory | Sid Lowe Read more

In last month’s Manchester derby, Bravo’s determination to play from the back almost cost City. Ter Stegen’s determination to do the same did cost Barcelona in their last game: two misplaced passes gave Celta Vigo two goals in a 4-3 win, making this their worst start in almost a decade, the debate heightening again. “It is my fault. We lost because of me,” Ter Stegen said. “But,” he added, “I won’t change my style completely” – not least because his manager does not want him to. After the derby Guardiola described Bravo as “exceptional”; after Vigo Luis Enrique insisted: “We won’t kill him for this. Barcelona’s goalkeeper always has to take risks.”

On Wednesday he will do so again. So, at the other end, will Bravo. If it seems to invite trouble, the way these two teams’ coaches see it, it invites them to play. This is the way they play, the gospel according to Johan Cruyff. His ideals underpin these clubs now, which is not to say they have always gone entirely unchallenged. Indeed, in Barcelona Cruyff stood at the heart of a debilitating civil war, which still echoes here and will on Wednesday, if quietly now. The divide still exists; some remain bitter towards Cruyff and towards Guardiola, his most determined disciple.

They are few, though: while some spat venom in Guardiola’s direction before his return last year, the belligerence baffling, virtually everyone else ignored them, grateful instead for what Guardiola built, what he represented, who he is: supporter, player, captain, ideologue, manager and now an opponent, faithful to those ideals but not, for one night only, the same club. In the end the reunion was as it should be: Guardiola was welcomed back and then beaten. The reaction this time will be even more “normalised”.

There was something telling in Jordi Cruyff’s remark as his father’s autobiography was published posthumously in London, Amsterdam and Barcelona this past week. “He’d say: ‘You have to die for people to love you,’” Jordi said, looking round the room in Barcelona. Some always did: Guardiola for a start, Begiristain too.

Guardiola told Donald McRae about Cruyff building a cathedral, “stone by stone”. Now he is trying to construct something similar in Manchester; the inspiration can be found in Catalonia and in Cruyff, its origins too. “Without him I would not be here for sure. I would not be Manchester City manager,” Guardiola said. And he would not be back again, where once he was a ballboy.                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279214-056f80071ed1ad28ef7a2f426c3ac8f1.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011620 00000000000 015165  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Cameron’s EU referendum was designed to defeat Ukip and the far right of his own party, and re-establish his camp of modernisers as dominant. But it backfired. The narrow referendum majority for Leave 18 months ago has brought an uncertainty over where we are headed.

Post-Brexit, UK governments will be expected to fulfill promises made during the referendum campaign. Immigration was a major reason for the result, but at least half of immigrants to the UK every year — those from South Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean — are unaffected by EU laws. It would also be difficult to reduce the number of EU citizens in the UK unless there is a (very misguided) programme to expel them, and the UK is prepared to countenance similar expulsions of its own citizens from the continent.

Many British voters also believed that by favouring Brexit they were voting for greater spending on the National Health Service and the rest of the British welfare state. Those voters will become even more dissatisfied when they discover that Brexit will not, in fact, provide anything close to the additional £350 million per week for our NHS that was claimed.

I accept the referendum result. The current political scenario provides a chance for us as a party to take control of how Brexit can be implemented in the national interest.

I strongly believe it is in our best interests to reach an agreement over the rights of EU citizens currently living in the UK – and UK citizens living in Europe – which includes continued recognition of professional qualifications, at the earliest opportunity.

For certain sectors which are heavily reliant on labour from the European Economic Area — construction (within which I have worked for two decades) and care are good examples — a hard line would have an extremely negative impact. Across the UK, EEA immigrants make up 10 per cent of registered doctors and 4 per cent of registered nurses, but that number is falling dramatically. The number of EU nationals registering as nurses in England has dropped by 92 per cent since the referendum, and a record number are quitting. A slowdown in EU migrants looking for work in the UK poses serious problems for our economy.

Britain’s exit from the EU must not imperil our pre-eminent position as a magnet for the finest talent from around the world. It is important that we work with businesses to ensure they remain within our country, and identify specific labour and skills shortages. For example, my county, Berkshire, has the highest concentration of foreign-owned companies among the 38 local enterprise partnerships areas.

It is also vital our trade agreement with the EU does not prevent economic growth, jobs and prosperity that comes with exporting our goods. Large businesses in my Slough constituency such as the confectionary producer Mars, have sites and factories that are interconnected across Europe, making up an integrated network in which raw materials are moved across borders and finished products made in one country are packaged, distributed and sold in others. Representatives of Mars are concerned over the return of barriers to the supply chain, and the possible impact on jobs. They told me:

“It is a fact that Europe after Brexit will remain a critical market for UK exports and likewise the UK will remain an important market for goods produced and manufactured in other European states. There can be no economic advantage either side restricting trade with a large market situated on its doorstep. In simple terms, if the UK and the EU fail to agree on a new preferential deal, it will be to the detriment of all.”

As the UN sustainable development goals make clear, international trade has an important role in sustainable development. The UK purchases a large amount from developing countries, on a basis largely governed by EU agreements. A future Labour government should guarantee to the least developed countries continued access to the UK market in the wake of Brexit. I therefore welcome the current government’s pledge to ensure these countries continue to have market access at the same level that they currently enjoy with the EU.

However, I believe the government must go further and make clear how it will ensure sustainable development remains a guiding principle of our trade policy. The government also needs to set out how it will extend preferential access to the UK market for developing countries currently covered by the EU’s wider generalised system of preferences. This could include establishing bespoke, non-reciprocal, tariff-free market access schemes for economically vulnerable countries immediately after Brexit.

More widely, I believe we need to make trade more inclusive to ensure its benefits are shared equitably between developed and developing countries. I will continue to support trade deals that are based on just relationships and shared values, and that will develop markets and raise income and standards in developing countries.                                                                                                                0279672-c003c5faef31f988048153f62711d81b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000011043 00000000000 014760  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Tom Hanks’ “Sully” is set to easily win the weekend’s domestic box office with about $25 million at around 3,400 locations.

Warner Bros. is opening “Sully” seven and a half years after Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger successfully landed a damaged US Airways jet in the Hudson River shortly after takeoff from La Guardia Airport. Clint Eastwood directed from a script by Todd Komarnicki, based on the autobiography “Highest Duty” by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow.

“Sully” premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on Friday and has received largely laudatory reviews with a current 77% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Warner Bros. will hold Thursday night preview showings at about 2,700 sites.

Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, Jamey Sheridan, and Jerry Ferrara are in supporting roles. This marks the first time that Hanks and Eastwood have collaborated.

Box office trackers are expecting “Sully” to launch in the same range as two titles — Hanks’ 2012 hostage drama “Captain Phillips,” which opened with $25.7 million on its way to a domestic total of $107 million; and Denzel Washington’s 2013 airline drama “Flight,” which launched with $24.9 million and grossed $93 million domestically.

Hanks’ most recent major release was last fall’s “Bridge of Spies,” which opened with $15 million for Disney. Steven Spielberg’s espionage drama showed solid staying power with a $72 million total.

“Sully” has a production budget of about $60 million, so it will need to show holdover strength in the following weekends to make it into profitable territory. Village Roadshow Pictures is a co-producer and co-financer with Warner Bros.

Three other titles are opening this weekend — Sony/Screen Gems’ “When the Bough Breaks” at about 2,200 sites; Lionsgate’s animated family comedy “The Wild Life” at 2,400 locations; and Relativity Media’s horror film “The Disappointments Room” at about 1,500 screens.

“When the Bough Breaks” will probably lead the trio, based on forecasts by Sony in the $10 million to $12 million range, while rivals predict the thriller will do as much as $20 million. That’s a decent start, given its modest $10 million production budget.

Morris Chestnut and Regina Hall portray a couple who desperately wants a baby and decides to hire a surrogate, played by Jaz Sinclair, who develops a psychotic fixation on the husband as the pregnancy progresses.

“When the Bough Breaks” is directed by Jon Cassar from a script by Jack Olsen. Former New Line toppers Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne are producing through their Unique Features production company.

“The Wild Life” is a Belgian-French adventure-comedy based on “Robinson Crusoe” by Daniel Defoe told from the point of view of the island’s animals, including an exuberant parrot, a goat, a tapir, a kingfisher, and a chameleon. Forecasts have pegged “The Wild Life” with a launch in the $5 million range.

“The Disappointments Room,” starring Kate Beckinsale and Lucas Till as a couple who moves into a rural dream house, was shot in 2014 by D.J. Caruso prior to Relativity’s bankruptcy and reorganization. The story centers on a secret room hidden within the attic. It’s the first Relativity title to hit the market since the mini-studio emerged from bankruptcy in April.

Relativity decided recently to move the film up by two months. “The Disappointments Room” has a $15 million budget and will probably finish in the $2 million to $4 million range. Sony’s third weekend of “Don’t Breathe,” which has led in the last two frames, may wind up in second or third place after taking in a surprisingly strong $55 million in its first 11 days.

The summer box office finished Monday on an upbeat note with $4.48 billion — comfortable to last summer after being down by 4.8% at the end of July. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore, said the upcoming weekend could represent a strong start to the post-summer period.

“The first weekend of fall will be marked by the counter programmed debuts of the serious minded ‘Sully’ and the guilty pleasure fun of ‘When the Bough Breaks’ to follow up on a surprisingly strong summer season,” he said. “The fall season looks to provide a very interesting mix of indie films, star powered vehicles, and of course the Oscar bait that the season is known for producing.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279692-e8027d7a4bf6d97ffe582e69364f71bd.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003512 00000000000 015243  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton by nearly an 11-to-1 margin according to a new poll published this week.

The Russian Public Opinion Research Center released a survey Tuesday indicating 87% of Russian citizens would prefer to see Trump become the next president of the United States, while the Democratic nominee failed to break into double digits by garnering only 8%.

Moscow-based political analyst Gleb Pavlovsky attributes Trump’s remarkable popularity among the Russian people to the real estate mogul’s unprecedented friendliness toward the nation’s leader, Vladimir Putin; Trump’s stance on NATO; and Putin’s past complimentary comments about Trump.

“The Russian people like Mr. Trump very much because they believe he will help make Russia great again,” Pavlosky explained. “He has said many times he wants to be friendly to Russia and admires Mr. Putin’s strong leadership very much. The people like this kind of talk very much more than the lady devil’s screeching.”

Trump will “remove NATO as stumbling block to summering on Russian territory on beautiful southern Baltic coast.”

Pavlosky added he has heard at least a few Muscovites indicate they believe, as president, Trump will “remove NATO as stumbling block to summering on Russian territory on beautiful southern Baltic coast.”

The poll, which surveyed 1,000 Russian residents, also showed 5% of Russians would like to see Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort — who has had notorious dealings with pro-Russian politicians such as former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych — become the 45th U.S. president.

According to RPORC, at least one respondent said, “I would very much like to see Russian agent Manafort in White House. He is strong like hrenovuha (horseradish vodka) and handsome like the Conway Twitty.”                                                                                                                                                                                      0279721-a6086f5ff8d4a13a820000ac56583527.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000013145 00000000000 014673  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Dwayne Johnson has topped Forbes magazine’s list of the highest paid male actors, earning $64.5m (£48.8m) in the last year – nearly $20m more than his female counterpart, Jennifer Lawrence.



The former wrestler, also known as the Rock, more than doubled his earnings from the previous year thanks to lucrative roles in the Fast and Furious franchise and the disaster movie San Andreas. Second in 2014, he bumped Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr, who had topped the list for three years running, from the top spot.

Forbes’s annual best-paid actors lists, which are divided between men and women, have again highlighted the huge pay gap between genders. Lawrence’s earnings are only 72% of Johnson’s, slightly lower than the pay disparity between white men and women in the US who earn an average wage.

Eighteen male actors took home over $20m, compared with only four female stars. Among them was Jackie Chan, who came second to Johnson with a pay packet of $61m. Matt Damon, paid $55m over the last year for starring in hits such as The Martian and Jason Bourne, Tom Cruise ($53m) and Johnny Depp ($48m) rounded out the male top five.

Lawrence is the world’s sixth highest paid actor. She earned $46m over the last year, putting her above male stars such as Ben Affleck ($43m) and Vin Diesel ($35m). The Hunger Games star, who wrote last year of about the injustice of being paid less than “lucky people with dicks” after the Sony hacks revealed she was paid less than her male American Hustle co-stars, is one of the few women paid anywhere near as much as the leading men. Second on the female list is Ghostbusters star Melissa McCarthy ($33m), who would place eighth on the male top 10. The lowest paid man on the male list of 20 (Harrison Ford – $15m) earned $5m more than the lowest paid woman of the female list of 10 (Indian star Deepika Padukone – $10m).

The lists also suggest older women are discriminated against when it comes to pay. Of the top male earners, 95% are over 40, compared to half of the women. Ford, at 74, is the oldest actor on both lists. The ages of the female stars are not listed on the Forbes press release, but Lawrence, 26, is the youngest.

Earlier this year Johnson, whose family struggled to pay rent when he was a teenager, reacted to the news that he was the highest paid actor on Forbes’s Celebrity 100 list by taking to Instagram, writing that his pay packet was “an anchoring reminder to continue to work even harder”. Lawrence, the daughter of a construction worker and a children’s camp manager, doesn’t have a social media presence and has not made a statement about her pay.

Forbes publishes the figures in a week when a new study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that women in the UK are on average earning 18% less than men in similar jobs. Despite dealing with some of the world’s best-paid artists, the issues they raise are relevant to everyone, said Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the women’s rights charity The Fawcett Society.

“This isn’t just a story about women at the top, it’s about women in every sector, at every level,” she said. “It reminds us all that it’s a structural problem we’re dealing with. It can happen to anyone. It can certainly happen to some of the biggest stars in the business. It helps to draw attention to the issue and that will keep the pressure on.

“The thing we have to remember though is that there are millions of women who are earning average salaries or less and will think, ‘What has this got to do with me?’ It’s important that we think about how to keep the focus on those women, although we want all women to be fairly paid.”

The lists, which show the actors’ earnings pre-tax and before the deduction of management fees, were produced by Forbes using data from Nielsen, Box Office Mojo and IMDb and interviews with agents, managers and lawyers. They are published at a time when female stars are becoming less hesitant in publicly criticising the entertainment industry for unfair pay. In May, House of Cards star Robin Wright told an audience at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York that she had threatened bosses at Netflix with going public unless she was paid the same as her male co-star, Kevin Spacey. In the same month, Mad Max: Fury Road star Charlie Theron, number six on this year’s list, spoke about her experience of campaigning for the same pay as her co-star The Huntsman: Winter’s War, Chris Hemsworth.

Male stars are typically less likely to be asked about the pay disparity and comment on the issue less frequenly. Among the few is Tom Hiddleston, who in October last year told the Guardian that equal pay for women in film should be “signed, sealed, delivered”.

Group of Texas A&M alumni calls his 'seven solutions' naïve, damaging

The "Open Letter to the Texas A&M University Community" criticized the proposals of Jeff Sandefer, an Austin businessman and architect of the "Seven Breakthrough Solutions," which have been championed by Perry as a means of making higher education more cost-effective. Sandefer, who has contributed nearly $450,000 to Perry's campaigns, sent his own mass email this week defending his ideas as a pathway to "a superior education at a far lower cost."

'Political intervention'

On Tuesday, 22 A&M graduates honored as "Distinguished Alumni" by the Association of Former Students warned that "an extraordinary level of political intervention in our university" could damage A&M's reputation, particularly "proposals to fundamentally change how research universities in Texas fulfill their educational responsibilities."

The signatories, most of them wealthy Texas businessmen who have contributed generously to their alma mater and have served in leadership positions at the university, ranged in graduation class from 1949 to 1967. Perry graduated from A&M in 1972.

"It is our opinion that several of these proposals will do significant damage," the alumni wrote. "We encourage you to ask the Board of Regents to end their well-known support for the seven proposals. We call on you to ask the board of Regents to resist inappropriate political intervention …"

Among the alumni signing the letter were three former TAMU regents, Robert H. Allen, Raul Fernandez and Don Aviles; two former members of the TAMU Foundation board, Jon Hagler and John E. Bethancourt; famed National Football League referee Red Cashion; a former director of the Johnson Space Center, Gerald Griffin; and Olympic gold medalist Randy Matson.

In response to one of the "seven solutions" promoted by Perry and Sandefer, Texas A&M published an online ranking of professors on their "productivity" based on the number of students they taught.

The ranking earned the university a rebuke from the prestigious Association of American Universities, an organization of the nation's top research institutions.

Email from Sandefer

The alumni's letter noted that the "seven solutions" have been met with deep resistance at the University of Texas at Austin, since the proposals call for splitting teaching and research duties and grading professors primarily on student evaluations. It argued that "the Texas A&M leadership should be as vigorous as UT in seeking to preserve its status as a Tier One university," a national designation reserved for top research institutions.

One of the signers of the letter, Joe B. Foster, of Houston, said he hoped the letter would "call attention to the fact that A&M and UT, as co-flagship institutions, don't need this kind of treatment."

This week, Sandefer, a former UT business lecturer who now runs his own private business college in Austin, sent a mass email urging Texans to become acquainted with the cost challenges facing higher education.

"In these tough economic times, appeals to research cannot be used to hide waste and inefficiency," he wrote. "Nor can we allow insiders to frighten donors and alumni as a way of avoiding touch questions about faculty productivity and costs," Sandefer added, noting that college tuition in Texas has doubled in the last 10 years.

Montero was linked with a move to West Ham a year ago and Sam Allardyce would appear keen to reignite his interest in the 24-year-old, who is currently on international duty at the World Cup in Brazil.

Another attacking recruit

Allardyce has been tasked by the West Ham owners to establish his side as a greater attacking force next season after the criticism levelled at the manager by supporters for the team’s negative style of player. Following the acquisition of forward Mauro Zarate, the Daily Express reports Allardyce now favours another South American recruit.

The Hammers are seemingly the frontrunners to sign Montero, although Arsenal have been credited with interest in the player. If West Ham are able to complete a deal, it will be the second time this summer they have landed a player to have been wanted by Arsenal, following the signing of Cheikhou Kouyate on Wednesday.

Needed at Arsenal?

While Arsenal’s name has been placed in the frame with regards Montero, it would seem unlikely that Arsene Wenger would mount a serious pursuit to sign the player given the vast options he already has in this position.

If there is an area in which the Gunners are spoilt for choice then it is on the flanks, with Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla all having frequenty occupied wide positions.

The priority for Wenger remains the signing of proven central striker rather than another wide-man, with Mario Balotelli appearing to be the most likely player to provide competition for Olivier Giroud at the Emirates Stadium from next season.

A ringing endorsement

Montero’s Premier League credentials have been endorsed by Antonio Valencia, the Manchester United player and Ecuador captain, who claims his international colleague is tailor made for the English top-flight.

Valencia, who may well leave Old Trafford this summer, responded with the following when asked which Ecuador player is must suited to the Premier League: "I would say Jefferson Montero because he is an intelligent player and someone who is improving his football daily."

This is good news indeed for West Ham, who will require a far greater contribution from the flanks next season in order to summon the best from striker Andy Carroll. Last summer they signed Stewart Downing from Liverpool, who proved a predictable disappointed, and fans will hope that Montero offers something of an upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0279750-9617b62ff12b93b842588ac315a202d8.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012544 00000000000 014707  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        ISS Science for Everyone

Slime molds form when individual cells swarm together and self-assemble into a blob, essentially a giant single cell containing thousands of nuclei. These unusual cells, which have already been found on the International Space Station, respond to external forces and stimuli by moving and changing their shapes. NanoRacks-Slime Mold Organization (NanoRacks-Slime Mold) treats slime molds with a series of stimuli while in microgravity, monitoring their responses and comparing them to slime molds on the ground.

Experiment Description

Research Overview



The NanoRacks-Slime Mold Organization (NanoRacks-Slime Mold) growth chambers contain slime molds that are exposed to differing chemical and physical stimuli.

The NanoRacks-Slime Mold microcontroller system has been developed by Texas A&M University.

This experiment uses a standard 1.5 U (10 cm by 10 cm by 15 cm) NanoRacks Module consisting of a LEXAN™ArduLab covered in Aluminum tape (High Temperature 3M™ Aluminum Tape).

Description



Slime molds have unique behavior. At times they behave like isolated single-celled organisms, at other times they assemble into slug-like multi-cellular organisms, and when they are under duress they can form fruiting bodies and sporulate. This behavior, in itself, is interesting but the behavior could be even more interesting when it occurs in microgravity. NanoRacks-Slime Mold Organization (NanoRacks-Slime Mold) investigates several questions: Will the single-celled organisms be able to self-assemble into the multi-celled organism in microgravity? Upon induction of sporulation, will the fruiting body be able to develop without the spatial organizing principle of gravity? Studies on Physarum have even shown that they have ability to learn and predict periodic stimuli .Will this ability transfer into a microgravity environment?



Professor John Tyler Bonner of Princeton University, has spent a lifetime studying slime molds. In his book The Social Amoebae: The Biology of Cellular Slime Molds he states that they are "no more than a bag of amoebae encased in a thin slime sheath, yet they manage to have various behaviours that are equal to those of animals who possess muscles and nerves with ganglia – that is, simple brains." The simplest statement of the project is that NanoRacks-Slime Mold aims to investigate whether or not slime molds can learn to adapt to a completely new environment.



In addition, there is some anecdotal evidence (gathered from a personal conversation with Dr. Don Pettit) that slime molds already exist on the ISS, having arrived there accidentally, but that they have not been studied. It is possible that our research could be helpful in understanding how slime molds function on the ISS and, perhaps, be applied to eliminating them or reducing their negative effects.

Applications

Space Applications

Slime molds and biofilms have been found on the ISS, and may grow differently in microgravity than they do on Earth. Better understanding of their behavior helps scientists develop countermeasures to dispose of them or control them.

Earth Applications

Improved understanding of slime mold behavior yields new methods for eliminating them or using them for human benefit on Earth. Slime molds self-replicate and self-organize, and their unique capabilities may lead to new biotechnology discoveries.

Operations

Operational Requirements and Protocols



The experiment needs to be immediately destowed, allowed to attain thermal equilibrium (1 hour), plugged into the NanoRacks Platform, and powered-up for 30 days of operations (±4 days) before return. Data is retrieved from the SD-card upon return.

NanoRacks Module-43 is destowed immediately and allowed to attain thermal equilibrium (1 hour). It is plugged into the NanoRacks Platform and operates autonomously for a minimum of 30 days (±4 days). NanoRacks Module-43 returns in cold stowage.

Mother Nature has been pretty kind to the snow sculptures and ice carvings this year, so you can still see those. For all the events through Sunday, go to wintercarnival.com.

If you’re headed to the Torchlight Parade, you can wave your own virtual torch. Just search for the “Pioneer Press Treasure Hunt” in your Android or Apple app stores, download it and look for the Vulcan Torch icon in the corner. Hit it and you can hold up a tiny torch when the Vulcans pass in the parade.

RED BULL CRASHED ICE

Just up the hill from the Winter Carnival action, Crashed Ice has returned with the fantastical apparatus that sends competitors in hockey skates down a huge, luge-like tube that starts at the St. Paul Cathedral and takes a dizzy 1,600 foot trip, dropping 12 stories down the hill.

The “Ice Cross Downhill” competition is back in St. Paul for the sixth time. Competition is Feb. 3 and 4. It’s free to watch and it draws tens of thousands. For more info: redbull.com.

GREAT NORTHERN FESTIVAL

Winter Carnival is part of the new Great Northern festival, a 10-day cross-metro event that includes the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships and the City of Lakes Loppet Ski Festival in Minneapolis under one banner Jan. 27-Feb. 5. There’s information at thegreatnorthernfestival.com, but a couple remaining highlights are:

Loppet ski festival: Because of the warm weather and lack of snow cover, most of the action has been moved to Theodore Wirth Park. The big event, the Luminary Loppet, will remain on Lake of the Isles on Saturday. It’s a “boots only” event this year, as walkers will hike around hundreds of luminaria, the Ice Pyramid, fire dancers, the Enchanted Forest, Ice-Cropolis, Ice-Henge and Ice-ster Island. Participants must register for the event and receive an official Luminary Loppet glow stick. The REI Luminary Party afterward is free for registered Luminary Loppet participants and $10 for everyone else. The Loppet festival is Friday-Sunday. More info at loppet.org.

Living Banners and Words for Winter — A poetry-inspired art installation by Piotr Szyhalski will “wrap” the Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis between 12th and Fifth streets, along with short poems about winter by local writers displayed on electronic road construction signs. The word-laden works will kick off with a recorded sound and light show in Peavey Plaza with four showings throughout the evening of Jan. 30. Living Banners will be on the Mall from Jan. 30 to Feb. 5.

ART SHANTY PROJECT

Those crazed-looking ice fishing houses on White Bear Lake in February are actually sheltering art experiences. The Art Shanty Project, in its third year on White Bear Lake, is a chance to interact with artists in a non-gallery environment. Some of this year’s shanties include a Chef Shanty, a Dance Shanty and an Air Hockey On Ice Shanty. On the more “unusual” side is the Slumber Party Shanty where “Visitors enter the shanty through a secret passage and make their way through the dark corners under the bed” before going upstairs to the slumber party. Or the I-C SPArkle-matic: “Like a human carwash, the I-C-SPArkle-Matic is a long enclosure with found objects that prod and poke the visitor as they make their way through the shanty.” Open Saturdays and Sundays in February.

ICE CASTLES

Icicles, caves, tunnels, slides and towering walls that look like they froze as they boiled. The Ice Castle in Lowell Park in Stillwater is cool. Fans of Disney’s “Frozen” will feel the Anna and Elsa vibe. The castle is open Fridays through Sundays. The entrance fee is $6.95 to $8.95 for children under 12, and $9.95 to $12.95 for adults, depending on day and time. Tickets can be purchased in advance at icecastles.com.

WINTER LIGHT

Internationally acclaimed artist Bruce Munro has installed five outdoor and two indoor pieces inspired by light at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum. His collection, titled “Light and Language,” illuminates the night with its soft glow, light animation and sounds. In one, 28 towers made of recycled plastic water-filled bottles with lights, set to music, slowly undulate. Another is formed from 19 lamp posts, which branch out like a giant seed head from a central core. 5-10 p.m. Thursday-Sunday, through April 9; Minnesota Landscape Arboretum, 3675 Arboretum Drive, Chaska; 952-443-1400; arboretum.umn.edu.                                                                                                                                                       0279621-145bff1babd2b43c24fb06867f15900e.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000004340 00000000000 015161  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Thrissur, Kerala: Six students of a leading government-aided college in Thrissur have been suspended for allegedly conducting a 'beef festival' inside the campus to protest against the lynching of a man in Uttar Pradesh over rumours of eating beef.

According to the management of Sree Kerala Varma College, the action was taken against the students, all activists of Students Federation of India, for serving beef inside the campus violating disciplinary rules of the institution.

The activists of SFI, the students' wing of CPI(M), had allegedly distributed beef and bread to students on 1 October as a symbolic protest against the beef ban initiated in some states and the gruesome killing of 50-year-old Iqlak, who was lynched at Dadri over beef eating rumours.

College Principal, CM Latha, said non-vegetarian dishes are not served within the college even during official functions and she had warned SFI activists not to distribute beef as it was against the custom of the institution.

"We are not against students' protests. But, in this case, I had warned students not to distribute beef within the campus and advised them to conduct the protest outside the college premises if they are so particular to do so," she told PTI.

"Our college has a tradition of not serving non-vegetarian dishes even for official functions. So, the management felt that it was not fair to distribute beef within the campus," she said.

The activists of SFI and ABVP, students' wing of BJP, had even clashed with each other over the conduct of the 'festival' the same day.

ABVP activists, who opposed the fest, were allegedly beaten up SFI members and police registered FIR against 12 'unidentified' students in this regard.

Latha said the action was taken also based on the news photos of the day and the police FIR.

The period of suspension would be decided by the disciplinary council of the college later, she added.

Founded by Maharaja of erstwhile Kochi state, Sree Kerala Varma College is now managed by Cochin Devaswom Board, an autonomous organisation under the state government.

A pretender is one who maintains or is able to maintain a claim that they are entitled to a position of honour or rank, which may be occupied by an incumbent (usually more recognised), or whose powers may currently be exercised by another person or authority. Most often, it refers to a former monarch, or descendant thereof, whose throne is occupied or claimed by a rival or has been abolished.[1][2]

The term "claimant" is sometimes preferred, but the term "pretend" in itself is not pejorative in this context. The original meaning of the English word pretend comes from the French word prétendre (and before that, the Latin praetendo meaning "to stretch out before"[3]), and originally meant "to put forward, to profess or claim". A pretender was, therefore, simply one who put forward or professed a claim to a title or, in modern terms, a claimant. Only later did the word acquire its modern sense of professing or claiming falsely.

The term "pretender" may apply to claimants with arguably genuine rights (as the various pretenders of the Wars of the Roses who regarded the de facto monarch as a usurper). It may also be used for those possessing an arguable right to a position who do not actively claim it, as well as impostors with wholly fabricated claims (as pretenders to Henry VII's throne Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck attest). People in the latter category often assume the identities of deceased or missing royalty to support their claim, and are sometimes referred to for clarity as false pretenders or royal impersonators. A pretender to the title of Pope is called an antipope.[4]

In the Roman Empire [ edit ]

Ancient Rome knew many pretenders to the offices making up the title of Roman Emperor, especially during the crisis of the Third Century.

These are customarily referred to as the Thirty Tyrants, which was an allusion to the Thirty Tyrants of Athens some five hundred years earlier; although the comparison is questionable, and the Romans were separate aspirants, not (as the Athenians were) a Committee of Public Safety. The Loeb translation of the appropriate chapter of the Augustan History therefore represents the Latin triginta tyranni by "Thirty Pretenders" to avoid this artificial and confusing parallel. Not all of them were afterwards considered pretenders; several were actually successful in becoming Emperor at least in part of the Empire for a brief period.

Greek pretenders [ edit ]

Byzantine Empire [ edit ]

Disputed successions to the Roman (Byzantine) Empire long continued at Constantinople. Most seriously, after the fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and its eventual recovery by Michael VIII Palaiologos, there came to be three Byzantine successor states, each of which claimed to be the Roman Empire, and several Latin claimants (including the Republic of Venice and the houses of Montferrat and Courtenay) to the Latin Empire the Crusaders had set up in its place. At times, some of these states and titles were subjected to multiple claims.

Cypriot pretenders [ edit ]

Following the defeat and death of King James III King of Cyprus in 1474, his younger and illegitimate brother, Eugène Matteo de Lusignan, also styled d'Arménie (died 1523) removed to Sicily, then to Malta. He was acknowledged as rightful heir to the thrones of Cyprus, Armenia, Jerusalem, and Antioch, although he never made serious efforts to pursue the claims. The title of "Barone de Baccari" was created in 1508 for Jacques Matteo (sives Eugene Matteo) d'Armenia with the remainder to his descendants in perpetuity.[citation needed] Eugene, illegitimate son of King Jacques II of Cyprus, had, when his family were exiled, first gone to Naples, then Sicily, then settled on Malta, marrying a Sicilian heiress, Donna Paola Mazzara (a descendant of the Royal House of Aragon of Sicily and Aragon), with issue.[5]

Modern Greece [ edit ]

The claimant to the throne of the last Greek kingdom is Constantine II, who reigned as king from 1964 to 1973. He belongs to the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, the senior branch of the House of Oldenburg. His designated heir is his son Pavlos, Crown Prince of Greece.

French pretenders [ edit ]

The establishment of the First Republic and the execution of Louis XVI in 1793 led to the king's son becoming pretender to the abolished throne, styled as Louis XVII. As Louis XVII was a child and imprisoned in Paris by the revolutionaries, his uncle, the Comte de Provence, proclaimed himself regent in his nephew's name. After Louis XVII died in 1795, the Comte de Provence became pretender himself, as Louis XVIII.

Louis XVIII was restored to the throne in 1814, and was succeeded by his brother Charles X in 1824.[1] Charles X was, however, forced into exile by the July Revolution. Charles X and his son, Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, abdicated their claims in favor of Charles's grandson, Henri, Count of Chambord; however, their cousin the Duke of Orléans, a descendant of Louis XIV's younger brother, mounted the throne as Louis Philippe I, King of the French.

For most of the July Monarchy, the legitimists, as supporters of the exiled senior line came to be known, were uncertain of whom to support. Some believed the abdication of Charles and his son legal, and recognized the young Chambord as king, while others maintained that abdication was unconstitutional in France of the ancien régime, and continued to recognize first Charles X and then Louis-Antoine, until the latter's death in 1844. On his uncle's death, Chambord claimed the crown, but lived in exile and upon his death in 1883, the direct male-line of Louis XV became extinct.

In 1848, Louis Philippe was himself overthrown by the February Revolution, and abdicated the throne in favor of his young grandson, Philippe, Comte de Paris. However, a republic was proclaimed, leaving Paris, like his cousin Chambord, merely a pretender to a no longer existing crown.[1] Over the next several decades, there were several attempts at a so-called "fusion", to unite both groups of monarchists in support of the childless Chambord as king, who would recognize the Count of Paris as his heir. Those efforts failed in the 1850s, but after the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870, when a royalist majority was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, fusion again became the monarchist strategy. As a result, in 1873 the Count of Paris withdrew his own bid for the throne and recognized Chambord as legitimate pretender to the French crown.[1] In spite of this apparent unity among royalist forces, restoration of the monarchy was not to be; Chambord refused to accept the Tricolor flag, which rendered him unacceptable to most Frenchmen as a constitutional king.[1] The monarchists hoped that after Chambord's death they could unite and crown the Orléanist candidate. But Chambord lived until 1883, while France's royalists had lost their majority in parliament by 1877.[1] The erstwhile Orléanist Adolphe Thiers thus called Chambord "The French Washington", i.e. the true "founder" of the Republic.

By 1883 the majority of French monarchists accepted the Count of Paris as rightful pretender to the French throne.[1] A minority of reactionaries, the so-called Blancs d'Espagne ("Spanish Whites"), continued to withhold support from the House of Orléans and chose instead Juan, Count of Montizon, the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne, who also happened to be the senior male descendant of Louis XIV.[1]

The arguments are, on one side, that Louis XIV's younger grandson, Philip de Bourbon, Duke of Anjou renounced any future claim to the French throne when he left France to become king of Spain as Philip V in 1700 (the renunciation was ratified internationally by the Treaty of Utrecht), ostensibly leaving the Dukes of Orléans as heirs to the throne of France in the event of extinction of descendants of Louis XIV's elder grandson Louis, Duke of Burgundy, which occurred in 1883.[1] On the other side, Anjou's renunciation is held to be invalid because prior to the revolution it was a fundamental tenet of the French monarchy that the crown could never be diverted from the rightful heir of Hugh Capet.[1] Moreover, although the Orléans volunteered to defer their rival claim to the throne after 1873, the regicidal vote of their ancestor Philippe Égalité in 1789 and the usurpation of Louis Philippe in 1830 are alleged to have extinguished all rights to the throne for the Orléans branch.[1] The schism has continued to the present day, with supporters of the senior line reclaiming the title of "Legitimist", leaving their opponent royalists to be known, once again, as "Orléanists". The current representative of the senior line is Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou, the senior legitimate living descendant of Hugh Capet (and of Philip V d'Anjou of Spain) who was born and raised in Spain. The Orléanist line, which returned to live in France when the law of banishment was repealed in 1950, is represented by Prince Jean, Duke of Vendôme, senior male-line descendant of King Louis Philippe.

In addition to these two claims to the historic royal throne of France, there have also been pretenders to the imperial throne of France, created first by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804 and recreated by his nephew Emperor Napoleon III in 1852 (abolished 1870). This claim is today disputed between Jean Christophe, Prince Napoléon and his own father, the self-avowed republican Prince Charles Napoléon (deemed to be excluded from the succession due to a non-dynastic re-marriage), both descendants of Napoleon I's youngest brother, Jérôme Bonaparte.

Russian pretenders [ edit ]

There is much debate over who is the legitimate heir to the Russian throne, and bitter dispute within the family itself.[6] Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna is considered by some to be the legitimate heir.[7] She is the only child of Grand Duke Vladimir who died in 1992, a great-grandson of Tsar Alexander II, whom some considered the last male dynast of the House of Romanov. Some of her opponents believe she is ineligible to claim the throne because she was born of a marriage that would have been deemed morganatic under Russia's monarchy, which was abolished in 1917.[6] Others oppose her for reasons similar to those of the anti-Orleanist rationale: her grandfather's perceived disloyalty and dynastic ambition are seen as removing any rights which might otherwise have belonged to her branch of the former dynasty.

Still others maintain that the restrictive, pre-revolutionary marital rules of the Romanovs leave no one who can claim to be rightful heir to the dynasty's legacy. Others recognized Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia as head of the family,[8] being a descendant of Emperor Nicholas I and the elected president of the Romanov Family Association, which consists of most living male-line descendants of the Romanov emperors. Neither he nor his younger brother, Prince Dimitri Romanov, had sons and since their deaths no new claims have been advanced by this branch.

Anna Anderson attempted to prove she was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia, the lost daughter of Nicholas II, but DNA testing on her remains eventually proved her to be an impersonator.[9] Although she did not claim the throne, per se, as women could not succeed to the Russian throne so long as any male dynast survived, she became more famous than any of the various Romanov claimants to the throne.[9]

Karl Emich of Leiningen, also known under his Christian Orthodox name Nikolai Kirillovich Romanov

Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen (born 1952), recently converted to the Eastern Orthodoxy,[10] is the latest pretender to the Russian throne under the name of Prince Nikolai Kirillovich of Leiningen. He is the grandson of Grand Duchess Maria Cyrillovna of Russia, (sister of Vladimir, and aunt of Maria Vladimirovna), and great-grandson of Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. The Monarchist Party of Russia supports Prince Nikolai as the heir of the Russian throne, since they are of the opinion that Maria Vladimirovna Romanova and Nicholas Romanov are not dynasts.[10] In early 2014, Nikolai Kirilovich declared himself Emperor Nicholas III (successor to Nicholas II).

In 2007 Nicholas married Countess Isabelle von und zu Egloffstein and in 2010 had a son, Emich.

British pretenders [ edit ]

England, Scotland and Ireland [ edit ]

After the execution of the Stuart King Charles I in 1649, his son Charles II became pretender until restored to the throne 11 years later. Charles II died in 1685 and his brother James II and VII came to the throne. He was the last Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland. James was deposed during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, and lived the remainder of his life as a pretender to the throne in exile. He made several attempts to regain the throne before his death in 1701. The Jacobite risings (or rebellions) were a series of uprisings or wars between 1688 and 1746 in which his supporters attempted to restore his line to the throne.

After 1807, the line of James II and VII became extinct. The Jacobites had ceased to have much political significance after the failure of the 1745 uprising, and the movement essentially became completely dormant after Henry's death. Genealogically, the next most senior line to the English and Scottish thrones was through James II's youngest sister, Henriette Anne, whose daughter had married into the House of Savoy. To the very limited extent that Jacobitism survived the death of Cardinal York, they supported the claims of this line. Its current representative is Franz, Duke of Bavaria, though he himself does not claim the title, his secretary having announced once that "HRM (sic) is very content being a Prince of Bavaria".

Other pretenders to the throne have included:

Wales [ edit ]

Owain Glyndŵr (1349–1416) is probably the best-known Welsh pretender, though whether he was pretender or Prince of Wales depends upon one's source of information. Llywelyn ap Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who died in 1282, was the only Prince of Wales whose status as ruler was formally recognised by the English Crown, though three of the four men who claimed the throne of Gwynedd between the assumption of the title by Owain Gwynedd in the 1160s and the loss of Welsh independence in 1283 also used the title or similar. Madog ap Llywelyn also briefly used the title during his revolt of 1294–95. Since 1301, the title of Prince of Wales has been given to the eldest living son of the King or Queen Regnant of England (subsequently of Great Britain, 1707, and of United Kingdom, 1801). The word "living" is important. Upon the death of Arthur, Prince of Wales, Henry VII invested his second son, the future Henry VIII, with the title. The title is not automatic, however, but merges into the Crown when a prince dies or accedes to the throne, and has to be re-conferred by the sovereign.

Nevertheless, it is Glyndŵr whom many remember as the last native Prince of Wales. He was indeed proclaimed Prince of Wales by his supporters on 16 September 1400, and his revolt in quest of Welsh independence was not quashed by Henry IV until 1409. Later, however, one of Glyndŵr's cousins, Owain Tudor, would marry the widow of Henry V, and their grandson would become Henry VII, from whom the current British monarch is descended (through his daughter Margaret Tudor, who married James IV of Scotland).

The various minor kingdoms that came together to form what is today known as the Principality of Wales each had their own royal dynasty. The most important of these realms were Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth. After 878 the ruling dynasties in these kingdoms each claimed descent from the sons of Rhodri Mawr who had conquered them or otherwise achieved their thrones during his reign. Merfyn Frych, the father of Rhodri Mawr, had come to power in Gwynedd because the native dynasty, known as the House of Cunedda had expired. Merfyn was descended from royalty through his own father Gwriad and claimed ancestors from among the rulers of British Rheged (in particular Llywarch Hen). It was acknowledged by all of the realms of Wales after the time of Rhodri Mawr that the House of Gwynedd (known as the House of Aberffraw) was senior and homage should be paid by each of them to the king of Gwynedd. After the reign of Owain ap Gruffudd of Gwynedd the realm began to merge with the concept of a Principality of Wales. This was realised by Owain's descendant Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1267. It was not to last and this new Wales was invaded by England and dismantled between 1277 and 1284. All of the descendants of Llywelyn "the last" and his brothers were either imprisoned or killed. Surviving members of the House of Aberffraw descended in the male line from Rhodri ab Owain Gwynedd in the guise of the Wynn and Anwyl families. Other surviving cadet branches of the Aberffraw and other Welsh princely houses have also survived into the modern age.

Irish pretenders [ edit ]

The business of Irish pretenders is rather more complicated because of the nature of kingship in Ireland before the Norman take-over of 1171. In both Ireland and early Gaelic Scotland, succession to kingship was elective, often (if not usually) by contest, according to a system known as Tanistry.

The High King of Ireland (Ard Rí) was essentially a ceremonial, federal overlord, who exercised actual power only within the realm which was his dynastic seat. Because of the laws of succession, there could not be a pretender to this title in the sense it is normally understood. From the 5th century onwards the kingship tended to remain within the dynasty of the Uí Néill until Brian Boru of Munster wrested control of much of Ireland from Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill in 1002. Following his death in 1014 and that of Máel Sechnaill in 1022, the struggle for dominance resulted in Norman intervention from Henry II of England in 1171.

There were later attempts by Irish rulers fighting against the Normans to revive the High Kingship such as in 1258 when Brian Ua Néill of Cenel Eoghan was so acknowledged, in 1262 when the crown was offered to Haakon IV of Norway and in 1315 when an offer was made to the Scottish Edward Bruce. Effectively, the title fell into abeyance. Apart from the coronation oath, the title was not even used by the Kings of England, each of whom styled himself Lord of Ireland. In 1542 Henry VIII, styled himself "King of Ireland".

Some Irish rebels discussed offering the Irish throne to Prince Joachim of Prussia (son of Kaiser Wilhelm II) before the 1916 Easter Rising.[11][12] After the failure of the Rising, the royalists were a minority among the rebels, and so the offer was never made.[citation needed] According to Hugo O'Donnell, 7th Duke of Tetuan, Éamon de Valera raised the idea of an Irish monarchy with his great-grandfather Juan O'Donnell.[13]

Ottoman pretenders [ edit ]

Cem Sultan, eldest of the sons of Mehmet the Conqueror born during his reign, claimed the Sultanate, but born during the reign of his father, he was defeated in battle months later by his eldest brother (by birth) Bayezid II. He fled to the island of Rhodes, then eventually to the Papal States. His descendants claimed his rights until Malta defeated the Ottomans in the 16th century. After the Ottoman Empire was abolished and the Republic of Turkey came into power, the successive heads of the Ottoman family claimed the throne of the Turkish empire. The latest pretender to the Imperial House of Osman is Dündar Ali Osman, since January 6, 2017.

Kingdom of Jerusalem [ edit ]

The Emperors of Ethiopia held the title of "King of Zion" through their claim of descent from the Biblical House of David through his son King Solomon. Menelik II dropped the use of this title. The Ethiopian Emperors continued to use the honorific of "Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah" up until the monarchy ended with the fall of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974.

Since the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, many European rulers have claimed to be its rightful heir. None of these, however, have actually ruled over a part of the former Kingdom. Today there are several potential European claimants on the basis of the inheritance of the title. None of the claimants have any power in the area of the former Kingdom. See the article Kings of Jerusalem for a list of potential claimants.

Japanese pretenders [ edit ]

In the fourteenth century, two lines of the Imperial clan, Northern Court and Southern Court, claimed the throne.[14] Their rivalry was resolved in 1392: while every emperor of the Southern Court enthroned prior to 1392 was established as legitimate, the throne was determined by Emperor Go-Komatsu of the Northern Court and his successors.

Since 1911, the Japanese government has declared the southern claimants were actually the rightful emperors despite the fact that all subsequent emperors including the then-Emperor Meiji were descended from the Northern Court, reasoning the Southern Court retained possession of the Three Sacred Treasures, thus converting the emperors of the former Northern court into mere pretenders. In other words, six former emperors of the Northern Court have been counted as pretenders instead since then. As a result of this compromise, the present Japanese Imperial Family is descended of the Northern Court Emperors.

Kumazawa Hiromichi publicly challenged Emperor Hirohito disputing the legitimacy of his bloodline.[15] Kumazawa claimed to be the 19th direct descendant of Emperor Go-Kameyama,[16] the last Emperor of the Southern Court.

Korean pretenders [ edit ]

Yi Seok, the Crown Prince Imperial is a descendant of the Joseon Dynasty and last prince of the abolished throne of Korea[17].

False pretenders [ edit ]

A number of individuals have claimed to be displaced monarchs or heirs who disappeared or died under somewhat mysterious circumstances:

There have also been individuals who claimed to be descendants of royalty:

Updated

Nick Kyrgios will get professional help, reducing his ATP ban from eight weeks to three, according to Tennis Australia (TA).

The governing body of the men's tour slapped Kyrgios with an eight-week suspension for his lack of competition during a match at the Shanghai Masters.

But the suspension could be reduced to three weeks if he "enters a plan of care under the direction of a Sports Psychologist, or an equivalent plan approved by ATP".

TA said it backed the ban and confirmed Kyrgios would take the latter route, allowing him to return to competition from November 7.

"Nick's health and wellbeing is a priority and the ATP has offered a reduced penalty on the provision that he seeks appropriate professional advice, which he has agreed to do," a TA statement read.

"Nick understands the gravity of his actions, has shown remorse and expressed a willingness to improve.

"We believe it's our responsibility to help Nick, along with all our young athletes, improve both professionally on court as a player, and personally.

"We have always offered assistance and advice to Nick and his team and will continue to do so."

The 21-year-old, for his part, apologised on Twitter after the offending match against Mischa Zverev and did so again in a statement after the ATP handed down its sanctions, which included an additional US$25,000 fine.

"The season has been a long one as I battled several injuries and other challenges towards the end of the summer," he said.

"The Asian circuit was particularly tough after the long week and win in Tokyo and with the travel throughout the continent, my body finally just gave out in Shanghai both physically and mentally.

"This is no excuse, and I know very well that I need to apologise to the fans — in Shanghai and in other parts of the world — as well as the tournament organisers in Shanghai who do an amazing job."

In a statement on his website, Kyrgios said he was looking forward to returning in 2017.

WASHINGTON — Fight night at Hofstra. The two boxers, confined within a ring of spectators — circling, feinting, taunting, staring each other down — come several times, by my reckoning, no more than one provocation away from actual fisticuffs, of the kind that on occasion so delightfully break out in the Taiwanese parliament. Think of it: The Secret Service storming the ring, pinning Mitt Romney to the canvas as Candy Crowley administers the 10 count.

The actual outcome was somewhat more pedestrian. President Obama gained a narrow victory on points, as borne out by several flash polls. The margin was small, paling in comparison to Romney’s 52-point victory in the first debate.

At Hofstra, Obama emerged from his previous coma to score enough jabs to outweigh Romney’s haymaker, his dazzling takedown of the Obama record when answering a disappointed 2008 Obama voter.

That one answer might account for the fact that in two early flash polls, Romney beat Obama on the economy by 18 points in one poll, 31 in the other. That being the overriding issue, the debate is likely to have minimal effect on the dynamics of the race.

The one thing Obama’s performance did do is re-energize his demoralized base — the media, in particular. But at a price.

The rub for Obama comes, ironically enough, out of Romney’s biggest flub in the debate, the Libya question. That flub kept Romney from winning the evening outright. But Obama’s answer has left him a hostage to fortune. Missed by Romney, missed by the audience, missed by most of the commentariat, it was the biggest gaffe of the entire debate cycle: Substituting unctuousness for argument, Obama declared himself offended by the suggestion that anyone in his administration, including the U.N. ambassador, would “mislead” the country on Libya.

This bluster — unchallenged by Romney — helped Obama slither out of the Libya question unscathed. Unfortunately for Obama, there is one more debate — next week, entirely on foreign policy. The burning issue will be Libya and the scandalous parade of fictions told by this administration to explain away the debacle.

No one misled? His U.N. ambassador went on not one but five morning shows to spin a confection that the sacking of the consulate and the murder of four Americans came from a video-motivated demonstration turned ugly: “People gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent and those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons.”

But there was no gathering. There were no people. There was no fray. It was totally quiet outside the facility until terrorists stormed the compound and killed our ambassador and three others.

The video? A complete irrelevance. It was a coordinated, sophisticated terror attack, encouraged, if anything, by Osama bin Laden’s successor, giving orders from Pakistan to avenge the death of a Libyan jihadist.

Not wishing to admit that we had just been attacked by al-Qaeda affiliates, perhaps answering to the successor of a man on whose grave Obama and the Democrats have been dancing for months, the administration relentlessly advanced the mob/video tale to distract from the truth.

And it wasn’t just his minions who misled the nation. A week after the attack, the president himself, asked by David Letterman about the ambassador’s murder, said it started with a video. False again.

Romney will be ready Monday.

You are offended by this accusation, Mr. President? The country is offended that your press secretary, your U.N. ambassador and you yourself have repeatedly misled the nation about the origin and nature of the Benghazi attack.

The problem wasn’t the video, the problem was policies for which you say you now accept responsibility. Then accept it, Mr. President. You were asked in the last debate why more security was denied our people in Libya despite the fact that they begged for it. You never answered that question, Mr. President. Or will you blame your Secretary of State?

Esprit d’escalier (“wit of the staircase”) is the French term for the devastating riposte that one should have given at dinner, but comes up with only on the way out at the bottom of the staircase. It’s Romney’s fortune that he’s invited to one more dinner. If he gets it right this time, Obama’s narrow victory in debate No. 2, salvaged by the mock umbrage that anyone could accuse him of misleading, will cost him dearly.

It was a huge gaffe. It is indelibly on the record. It will prove a very expensive expedient.                                       0279724-5598a5eb3ce2ae93694834cc83c8592b.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000001716 00000000000 015075  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The World Trade Organization WTO sign is seen at the entrance of the WTO headquarters in Geneva.

Warsaw - Poland will file a complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over the Russian ban on Polish exports of fruit and vegetables, Polish Agriculture Minister Marek Sawicki said. “We couldn't file a complaint earlier, because we only received the first official correspondence (about the ban) on Wednesday, before that we only had the information provided by the media,” Sawicki was quoted as saying by daily Gazeta Wyborcza on Friday.

The announcement follows the European Commission's decision to set up a task force comprising of European agriculture officials to analyse the impact of the Russian ban on EU exports.

My latest post on the trailmeme blog, Four-Hour Workweek or Executricks? should be of interest to ribbonfarm readers.

There are two major views of the brave new world of work that is being created by social media tools. The first is the free agent dream of quitting the cubicle, striking out on your own, and settling into a comfortable, undemanding and lucrative niche by 40. Tim Ferriss’ 4-Hour Work Week is the how-to bible of this gang. This is the gang that believes in overt lifestyle design, mini-retirements, a public “personal brand” and the like. The lesser-known dream is an under-the-radar version best described in Stanley Bing’s Executricks. This looks very similar, but actually sounds more deliciously subversive: using the exact same tools to “retire at work,” develop an under-the-radar personal brand, and achieve covert lifestyle design…Which view is smarter? Which view do you subscribe to? Let me frame the decision for you; it is subtler than you think.

I am planning to move my more tech-based/topical/practical “future of work” writing to the Trailmeme blog, leaving the more conceptual stuff here. Kind of a relief, since I like talking about the relationship between technology and work/life styles at a practical level, but have felt, of late, that that stuff doesn’t quite fit with the more philosophical ribbonfarm mode.

When will a disk drive fail? The people at BackBlaze, who use 67,814 disk drives, have been looking at Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) disk drive statistics to try to predict this.

They’ve been looking at this for a while, at least since 2014. As I wrote then:

“SMART defines — and measures, for those vendors that support it — more than 70 characteristics of a particular disk drive. But while it’s great to know how many High Fly Writes or Free Fall Events a disk has undergone, these figures aren’t necessarily useful in any real sense of being able to predict a hard drive failure.

“Part of this is because of the typical problem with standards: Just because two vendors implement a standard, it doesn’t mean they’ve implemented it in the same way. So the way Seagate counts something might not be the same way as Hitachi counts something. In addition, vendors might not implement all of the standard. Finally, in some cases, even the standard itself is…unclear, as with Disk Shift, or the distance the disk has shifted relative to the spindle (usually due to shock or temperature), where Wikipedia notes, ‘Unit of measure is unknown.’”

At that point, BackBlaze had determined that out of the 70 statistics SMART tracked, there was really only one that mattered: SMART 187, or Reported_Uncorrectable_Errors. At the time, BackBlaze wrote: “Drives with 0 uncorrectable errors hardly ever fail. Once SMART 187 goes above 0, we schedule the drive for replacement.”

Since then, the company has been looking at the SMART statistics some more, and it’s now added four other statistics that it’s determined have a correlation to failed drives, writes senior marketing manager Andy Klein:

SMART 5 Reallocated Sectors Count

Reallocated Sectors Count SMART 188 Command Timeout

Command Timeout SMART 197 Current Pending Sector Count

Current Pending Sector Count SMART 198 Uncorrectable Sector Count

The company didn’t say why it started looking at other SMART statistics if it had already determined that there was one statistic that was correlated with failure. (It also makes its raw statistics available in case you want to play with correlations yourself.) He also points out that not all vendors report all the statistics, or in the same way — an issue two years ago as well.

Another factor is the period of time in which the errors occur, Klein writes. “For example, let’s start with a hard drive that jumps from zero to 20 Reported Uncorrectable Errors (SMART 187) in one day,” he writes. “Compare that to a second drive which has a count of 60 SMART 187 errors, with one error occurring on average once a month over a five year period. Which drive is a better candidate for failure?” He doesn’t actually say, though he implies that it’s the first one.

Incidentally, BackBlaze has even started looking at High Fly Writes as a possible indicator of future disk failure. “This stat is the cumulative count of the number of times the recording head ‘flies’ outside its normal operating range,” Klein explains, noting that while 47 percent of failed drives have a SMART 189 value of greater than zero, so do 16.4 percent of drives that work. “The false positive percentage of operational drives having a greater than zero value may at first glance seem to render this stat meaningless. But what if I told you that for most of the operational drives with SMART 189 errors, that those errors were distributed fairly evenly over a long period of time?” he asks. “For example, there was one error a week on average for 52 weeks. In addition, what if I told you that many of the failed drives with this error had a similar number of errors, but they were distributed over a much shorter period of time, for example 52 errors over a one-week period. Suddenly SMART 189 looks very interesting in predicting failure by looking for clusters of High Fly Writes over a small period of time.”

That’s not to say that any of the statistics, or even a combination of them, is a perfect predictor of when a disk drive is going to fail – or when it isn’t. The organization points out, “Operational drives with one or more of our five SMART stats greater than zero – 4.2 percent. Failed drives with one or more of our five SMART stats greater than zero – 76.7 percent,” writes Klein. “That means that 23.3 percent of failed drives showed no warning from the SMART stats we record.” But if nothing else, it sounds like starting to see these particular SMART errors is a way to bet.

RIA Novosti

09:34 30/07/2010 MOSCOW, July 30 (RIA Novosti) - Russian defense spending will increase by 60 percent, to more than 2 trillion rubles ($66.3 million) by 2013 from 1.264 trillion ($42 million) in 2010, a leading Russian business daily said on Friday.

The Russian government made the relevant decision during a meeting on Thursday. The largest growth is planned for 2013, when the figure will rise by 0.5 trillion rubles ($16.6 million), Vedomosti reported.

Konstantin Makiyenko from the Russian Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (CAST) told the paper that the government is likely to spend more on the Navy, as well as the aviation and space industries.

The construction of advanced submarines, including Yasen and Borei class subs, and Bulava ballistic missiles, as well as the construction of three new Talwar class frigates, three Improved Kilo class subs and other vessels for the Russian Black Sea Fleet are likely to require the largest part of the planned spending, Makiyenko said.

The budged allocation should also consider spending on the construction of the first two Mistral class amphibious assault ships under a Russian-French deal, a Russian military plant manager told Vedomosti. This may account to about $0.5 billion, he estimated.

Russia is currently in talks with France on the purchase of two Mistral class helicopter carriers and the construction of two others under a French license.

Besides this, Russia is planning to spend 80 billion rubles ($2.65 billion) on 60 Su-family fighter jets starting 2010, and buy 26 MiG-29K Fulcrum-D carrier-based fighter jets, with the expected contract estimated at about 25 billion rubles (more than $828 million), a military aircraft plant manager told the paper. The plans also include the purchase of 32 Su-34 Flanker fighter bombers under the 2008 contract (a single plane then cost more than 1.1 billion rubles ($36.4 million), he said.

“What a difference a year makes, last year he was hurt a little bit” Coach Marlon Garnett said. “Hopefully he continues to build on that brick and that foundation.”

Bender looks comfortable and confident as he’s embracing a new role: point-forward. General Manager Ryan McDonough and Head Coach Earl Watson have both praised Bender’s playmaking potential and now the proof is on the court.

“Growing up I did it a lot,” Bender said about his ball handling. “Just playing with the ball, playing pick and roll. Just being that point-forward guy. That distributor on the offensive end trying to pass the ball to open shooters on the floor and trying to spread the court.”

The seven-foot-one big man uses his height advantage and vision to make passes that most players can’t. This unique versatility can keep opposing defenses off guard and create constant mismatches throughout a series.

“I was just watching a clip yesterday from the practice,” Garnett said. “He got a rebound and pushed it down the floor, defense collapsed in the paint and he kicked it out to the corner to Derrick Jones.”

Bender grew up playing this type of basketball and has learned from other front-court distributers in the NBA.

“Draymond Green is a stereotype of that guy,” Bender said. “In the past there was a lot of guys who were trying to play that way. The guy I was watching growing up was Toni Kukoč. I was growing up in the same club, growing up in the same city. He was the guy I was trying to steal some of those moves from him.”

Not only are his skills on display, but his work in the weight room is beginning to show off. At the start of last year he weighed in at 225 and is currently up to 240.

“Definitely stronger,” Bender said. “I came pretty early back here just to work on that stuff in the weight room with the guys here. Just trying to put my game at a higher level.”

The Croatian point-forward will display his new role on Friday when the Summer Suns take the court against the Sacramento Kings in Vegas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               0279719-171422e98aede108bd808378160d95f2.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007136 00000000000 014724  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The White House threatened to veto a controversial House cybersecurity bill on Wednesday, saying the measure would fail to protect critical infrastructure systems and would undermine Internet privacy.

The House is expected to approve the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) on Friday.

"Legislation should address core critical infrastructure vulnerabilities without sacrificing the fundamental values of privacy and civil liberties for our citizens, especially at a time our Nation is facing challenges to our economic well-being and national security," the White House said.

The goal of CISPA is to help companies beef up their defenses against hackers who steal business secrets, rob customers' financial information and wreak havoc on computer systems. The bill would tear down legal barriers that discourage companies from sharing information about cyber threats.

The administration said it supports increasing information-sharing but that CISPA lacks adequate privacy protections.

Reps. Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) and Dutch Ruppersberger (D-Md.), the authors of CISPA, announced amendments on Tuesday to address the concerns of privacy advocates, but the changes were apparently not enough to appease the White House.

In a statement, Rogers and Ruppersberger said their amendments "address nearly every single one of the criticisms leveled by the Administration, particularly those regarding privacy and civil liberties of Americans."

The administration criticized CISPA for not requiring that companies strip out personally identifiable information, such as names or birthdays, from the data they turn over to the government. The administration also said the bill should be amended to ensure that the data is only used for appropriate purposes.

"Citizens have a right to know that corporations will be held legally accountable for failing to safeguard personal information adequately," the White House said.

The administration emphasized that a civilian agency such as the Homeland Security Department — not military spy agencies — should have a central role in handling the cyber threat information.

The statement also argued that CISPA would grant overly broad liability protection to companies that share cyber threat information.

"This broad liability protection not only removes a strong incentive to improving cybersecurity, it also potentially undermines our Nation's economic, national security, and public safety interests," the White House said.

Unlike a cybersecurity bill in the Senate, CISPA would not set mandatory security standards for critical infrastructure systems such as electrical grids or chemical plants.

The White House and backers of the Senate cybersecurity bill argue that mandatory standards are necessary to prevent a catastrophic cyberattack.

"The Congress must also include authorities to ensure our Nation's most vital critical infrastructure assets are properly protected by meeting minimum cybersecurity performance standards," the White House said on Wednesday.

But GOP House leaders have indicated they will not allow a vote on any bill that creates new regulations for cybersecurity. Critics of the mandates say they are unnecessary and would be burdensome for businesses.

The White House argued that "voluntary measures alone are insufficient responses to the growing danger of cyber threats."

In the statement, the White House said "looks forward to continuing to engage with the Congress in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion to enact cybersecurity legislation," but that if Congress passed the current version of CISPA, the president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  0279630-02655ddecb444c164598b61152d1c220.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000007174 00000000000 014667  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Staring down your first Major League Soccer start has to be a mix of excitement and trepidation. And for the LA Galaxy’s 22-year old Nathan Smith, the next 24 hours could be all those emotions and more.

Signed to the senior team on March 2, 2017, as a Homegrown player, just two days before the LA Galaxy opened their season with a 2-1 loss to FC Dallas, Smith is now staring down the likelihood of an MLS debut on Sunday.

With Ashley Cole still coming back from a calf injury — he’s been training and might be back in time for the Galaxy’s first away game against Real Salt Lake on Saturday, March 18 — and the suspension to Dave Romney, Smith looks to be next in line.

“I’m feeling confident. Anything can happen. I’m hoping that I am starting, but it’s not announced yet,” Smith told CoG after training on Saturday. “I’m just hoping for the best — just keeping ready as if I’m going to start.”

Smith, from his hometown of Clovis, California, spent last year with the LA Galaxy’s USL affiliate, LA Galaxy II, after forgoing his senior year at UCLA. And Before that Smith was an LA Galaxy academy player. So the Galaxy knew what they were getting when they signed him.

As an added benefit, Smith has already played under Head Coach Curt Onalfo. “It’s good that I got a year with him [Onalfo], with the second team under my belt,” Said Smith. “I’m familiar with him, his system, how he wants us to play. So it’s helped out tremendously.”

If he’s going to start on Sunday, something that neither he nor Onalfo would confirm, Smtih may find some confidence in going against the Timbers. Before the start of the season, the Galaxy faced off against Portland, in a match at StubHub Center — a game they ultimately lost. In the second half, Smith was called upon to step in for Jelle Van Damme after Van Damme came down with food poisoning. Romney slid over to the center back position and that left Smith to patrol at left back.

“It helps a lot that I’ve seen them [Portland] already, and I went against them. So it shouldn’t be anything too new,” Smith said with young confidence. “I expect them to score a lot of goals since they put five [goals] against Minnesota. So a lot of flair going forward with Adi, Nagbe, and Valeri and their number 10. Just a lot of pressure from them attacking.”

Smith has the nod of confidence from Galaxy Head Coach Curt Onalfo who spoke highly of the young defender. Saying that Smith could play anywhere on the back line and that if he’s called upon on Sunday, he knows smith can perform the task.

Smith is expected to line up next to Jelle Van Damme, Daniel Steres, and Rafa Garcia. Garcia is playing for the injured Robbie Rogers, and with no timeline for Rogers’ return, Smith could also be auditioning for the backup on the other side as well.

Could Nathan be the key to LA surprising Portland? Here’s a video, showing Smith on the left side, playing for the US U-17 Men’s National Team. Nathan takes a casual pass from “John” McBean — also known as Jack McBean — in the 92nd minute of the match.

Smith pulls the ball inside, and with his right foot, blasts a long shot to the far post for the US win.

Whether or not Smith and the Galaxy can stack up against a very good Timbers team will be of utmost importance. After losing to FC Dallas last weekend, the team will need to find some points from their second consecutive home game. Otherwise, they’d risk starting 0-2 at home — something that has never happened in franchise history.

The Galaxy will kick off at 4:00 PM from StubHub Center on Sunday, March 12, 2017 and can be watched live on Fox Sports 1.

From the beginning we felt that Warsi's appointment was tokenistic because the Tory DNA is in essence white, male, Anglo Saxon and Protestant to its core.

The signs that she was recruited as part of a 'tick box' form of politics were there from the start. She was a politician who had never won an election, yet she was promoted to the House of Lords and given a Cabinet appointment without humbler Government experience. Mind you, the fact that she was co-chair, rather than completely in charge, should have given her an early indication that her party only half-trusted her to execute the role she had been tasked with.

Notwithstanding the crude nature of such gesture politics, her appointment was nonetheless a political master-stroke. Recognising the Conservatives' persistent image as the' nasty party', David Cameron saw her real value as someone who could prop up the image of a modern reformist party comfortable in its multi-cultural skin.



The chimaera of an Asian woman influencing the levers of Tory power did prop up this illusion for most of the two-and-a-half years that Warsi was in the Cabinet. She offered the Tory party a plethora of photo opportunities that would have been a PR company's dream: the iconic image of Warsi smiling to camera dressed in a traditional Pakistani salwaar khameez against the backdrop of a predominantly male grey-suited Cabinet. She was the patriotic poster girl for British integration in a Union Jack-inspired traditional shawl celebrating the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.



One could argue that it is unfair to expect Sayeeda Warsi to carry the burden of ethnic representation and she ought to be judged on the merits of her performance in office. That would be true of the other Tory minority ethnic MPs who have wanted to be judged on their own terms rather than as a member of the community.

It was clear that as a working class, northern, Muslim woman, Warsi was expected to carry the mantle of race and faith when she was brought into office as the shadow minister of community cohesion and she carried off this role with considerable panache. In many of her party's pronouncements on issues affecting minority communities she was working alongside the Prime Minister helping him negotiate the fractious politics of ethnicity and religion.

It is widely known that Warsi was the co-architect of the PM's controversial speech on multiculturalism and British Islam at the Munich Security Conference in February 2011, in which Cameron called on Muslims to embrace British values. Throughout her political tenure she has been key to helping the party formulate its policy on terrorism and extremism.

Yet when it has come to asserting minority rights she has essentially remained silent on the issue. It was on her watch that the Equality Act has been eroded and the Equality and Human Rights Commission's role as the government watchdog for protected groups made impotent when their funding was halved. For a minister who came from a immigrant Pakistani family in Dewsbury, she has stood too much aside while the government has imposed measures such as increasing the income threshold for those wanting to sponsor a non-EU spouse or partner.

In the end, despite Warsi's attempts to follow Conservative policies loyally and make a political career for herself, she came up against the party line. In one of the very few interventions she made on behalf of the Muslim community - when she gave a speech condemning Islamophobia and declared that prejudice against Muslims had "passed the dinner table test" - her party seemed to turn on her.

She was investigated, earlier this year, for breaking ministerial rules in what to many seemed a contrast to the treatment of Jeremy Hunt over his handling of Rupert Murdoch's bid to control BSkyB.

In making the decision to replace Warsi it weems clear that the PM has ignored her plea to retain her in the cabinet post because "I'm a woman, I'm not white, I'm from an urban area, I'm from the north, I'm working class – I kind of fit the bill." The tragedy is that despite the changing demographic profile of the UK, Warsi does not fit the cabinet demographic bill that has dominated UK politics for so long. In demoting her to a newly created post as senior minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs and then allowing her to attend Cabinet meetings, the Prime Minister is engaging in more and worse tokenism. Warsi should retain her self-respect by leaving the Conservative party and exposing the sham that underlies mainstream politics today.

Three of the United States’ largest military contractors each won multimillion-dollar projects in the last month to boost American offensive power in the cyber domain.

Raytheon, Northrop Grunman and Booz Allen Hamilton have all seen their stock prices rise 10 to 20 percent since the November 2016 U.S. election. Investors sprinted to military contractors based on Trump’s promises for higher spending on — among other warfighting capabilities — the cyber domain. Many of the world’s biggest weapons manufacturers are expanding aggressively into offensive and defensive cybersecurity in search of the same level of profitability found in building conventional weapons systems.

Raytheon will build the Air Force’s newest Cyber Command and Control Mission System (C3MS) operating location — at San Antonio’s Lackland Air Force Base — after winning an $8.5 million contract this week. Lackland is home to the 24th Air Force, the organization tasked with operating and defending the Air Force’s networks. It’s currently commanded by Maj. Gen. Christopher Weggeman.

The C3MS system is designed, by the military’s description, to extend the U.S. Air Force’s “global reach, power and vigilance” into the cyber domain by providing permanent operational support to combatant commanders around the world. In addition to securing Air Force networks and information processing systems, C3MS includes offensive cyberspace operations, expansive real-world and cyber domain surveillance capabilities and close coordination with other key cyber domain commands including the United States Cyber Command.

C3MS has been described as the system watching all the other systems. It sits atop, commands and controls the Air Force Cyberspace Defense weapons system, the Cyber Security and Control System program, Air Force Intranet Control (which just awarded a $14.7 million contract to the firm Cyber Defense Information Assurance for defensive capabilities), Cyberspace Defense Analysis and the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/Hunter Weapon System. The project is expected to be complete by April 28, 2018.

Northrop Grumman won a $9.4 million contract earlier this month from the Air Force to further develop the Cyber Mission Platform (CMP) in San Antonio. The CMP is the hardware and software host for the Air Force’s offensive cyber operations. Much about the project is classified. The CMP develops offensive hacking capabilities and facilitates ongoing upgrades and modifications to the classified Network Attack System, also located in San Antonio.

Booz Allen Hamilton won a $10 million contract in mid-March for research on building high-power electromagnetics into the Air Force’s cyberwarfare and electronic warfare applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   0279782-60fa43e86aa13e929444238a72d656f4.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000014267 00000000000 014727  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The arrests of two Swedish journalists – captured by security forces in early July after a firefight with ethnic Somali rebels – and the detention of a long stream of local journalists with critical views of the Ethiopian government is showing once again the ruthless streak of America’s biggest friend in the Horn of Africa.

Prime Minister Meles Zenawi – president of Ethiopia from 1991 to 1995, and premier of Ethiopia ever since – is praised for his economic vision in steering the country toward a path of economic growth and foreign investment, as well as his cooperation with the US’s counterterrorism efforts in Africa. But Mr. Meles’ decisiveness and vision is matched by an intolerance of dissent, critics say.

Over the past year, more than 100 opposition activists, local journalists and others have been detained under a catch-all anti-terror law that can mean up to 20-year jail terms for those who merely publish a statement that prosecutors believe could indirectly encourage terrorism.

Former president of the republic Negasso Gidada, who left the ruling Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in 2001 to join the opposition, says that Meles and his followers still hold a belief agreed a decade ago that they are the only ones capable of leading the historically impoverished nation to prosperity.

"They decided then it is only the EPRDF which can lead the country to middle-income level in 20 to 30 years' time," he says. "All other organizations should to be brought on board or eliminated."

Little room for dissent

Meles' proven track record in overseeing economic growth and stability lead some to praise his rule. Human rights groups and journalist organizations complain that the government targets those who simply disagree with the ruling party.

Senior government spokesman Shimeles Kemal rejects rights groups’ claims that the pattern of arrests reveals an intolerance of dissent. He says that those arrested for terrorism – including the two Swedish journalists – have left behind evidence of links with banned militant groups. Ethiopia’s concerns over terrorist threats were bolstered recently by a recent UN report detailing an Eritrea-backed plot by rebels aiming to cause carnage in downtown Addis Ababa during an African Union summit in January this year.

Connections of some sort between opposition politicians and outlawed organizations such as Ginbot 7 are possible. Ginbot 7’s exiled leader, Berhanu Nega – sentenced to death in-absentia for his role in a tumultuous 2005 election – was a former colleague in the defunct Coalition for Unity and Democracy.

But while exploiting such connections to crush the opposition is a predictable maneuver, the prosecution of the Swedish journalists Johann Persson and Martin Schibbye is a departure for the government.

Tougher line on foreign journalists?

Previously, foreign journalists who fell out of favor with the Ethiopian authorities suffered only deportation. Mr. Persson and Mr. Schibbye, detained after being captured with members of the autonomy-seeking Ogaden National Liberation Front, have been charged with supporting a terrorist group. Prosecutors say they confiscated a video of the pair, which shows them handling weapons.

Colleagues at Kontinent News Agency claim the pair were acting in the finest tradition of the profession: having prepared for 6 months, they covertly entered Ethiopia's closed Ogaden region with the intention of investigating the human cost of the armed insurgency and the state's response. The video, they say, is shot in Somalia and shows the gun of a private guard, not a rebel.

Being captured with armed rebels, of course, is one thing. Some Ethiopian opinion makers and politicians, like activist Andualem Arage, and virulently anti-EPRDF columnist Eskinder Nega, were arrested after calling for a year of non-violent action, similar to the mass protests that swept North Africa.

Negasso says the arrest of Andualem was simply due to his bravery and popularity, since Andualem is a pacifist, unlike former Addis Ababa mayor-elect Berhanu Nega, who says if all else fails violence may be used to achieve liberation. "He preaches love, tolerance and a peaceful struggle," says Negasso, who scoffs at any possibility of his involvement in terrorism. "If you hit him he would turn the other cheek."

With larger projects like the historic dam on the Blue Nile River in the works – a scheme that should make Ethiopia an electricity provider for the region - Meles and his party have no time for such insolence. In truth, they never have. While political pluralism peeped round the door at a 2005 poll with historic opposition gains, it never showed its face. When opposition supporters protested the official results – which kept Meles in power – soldiers shot dead almost 200 of them. Leaders and activists were accused of treason, imprisoned, and then many fled following pardons two years later.

Legitimate security concerns and the possibility of unrest may have made a jittery government come down hard on the detractors. However, it is a continued fervent belief in the virtue of the ruling vanguard's mission that is likely to be the fundamental cause of the current unforgiving approach.

The strong bonds forged with emerging giants like China means the government is in position to achieve some of the ambitious goals set out in a 5-year growth plan unveiled last year. New hydropower plants will make it the power hub of Eastern Africa; deficiencies in cement and sugar will become exported surpluses; a railway network linking towns and industries is promised; an archaic agricultural system will be transformed by irrigation.

Such lofty aspirations become more realizable considering that Western largesse still pours forth, from the US and from others. Ethiopia's role as regional enforcer and record of economic and social development easily outweighs any quibbles in European and American corridors of power about the revolutionary democrats' reluctance to follow their liberal democratic model.

Given its uncompleted mission and the privileged geopolitical middle-ground it still occupies, two decades after overthrowing Hailemariam Mengistu's Marxist military junta, the EPRDF is not about to allow itself to be dethroned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         0279739-0032ddd72cb33029e0e4337013e21a4a.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010477 00000000000 014735  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        New England is in danger of squandering its conservation “second chance,” according to the authors of a new Harvard Forest report.

The region, heavily deforested in colonial days, is today one of the most densely wooded in the world, thanks to forests that regenerated over the past 150 years as farms were abandoned for city life.

But that reforestation has peaked, and New England is now losing 65 acres of forest to development each day, the report says. In addition, funding for land conservation has fallen 50 percent since 2008, and the acreage conserved annually is also down, falling more than sixfold since the early 2000s, from 333,000 acres a year to about 50,000 acres a year since 2010.

“Peak forest cover is over in New England,” said Jonathan Thompson, a senior scientist at Harvard Forest and one of the report’s 31 authors. “For more than 150 years, forests expanded and regrew. That history is how we gained the status as among the most populated and most forested regions in the world.”

Thompson said that about 88 percent of New England is forest or farmland, but that development — 50 percent of which is residential — amounts to a “hard, permanent” deforestation that removes the land from natural uses for the foreseeable future.

“If current rates continue, New England will lose another 1.2 million acres by the year 2060 — that’s an area nearly twice as big as Rhode Island,” he said.

While climate change threatens to alter natural communities and favors some species over others, development eliminates ecosystems altogether, Thompson said. In addition, he said, land is our biggest asset in fighting climate change, with growing trees locking up carbon and natural areas buffering the effects.

The report, “Wildlands and Woodlands, Farmlands and Communities,” calls for tripling conservation efforts across the region, with the aim of setting aside 30 million acres of forest covering 70 percent of New England, as well as all of its remaining farmland. Ten percent of the conserved acreage would be set aside as wildland, while the rest would be managed sustainably for wood products and other forest-related benefits.

In order to achieve that level of conservation, the report’s authors call for increased public funding, integrating land conservation with urban and municipal planning, and ensuring that land dedicated for economic development is used as efficiently as possible.

Harvard Forest Director David Foster, the report’s senior author, sees cities and towns as partners in such efforts. He offered the example of former mill towns that have seen redevelopment of industrial buildings, creating desirable residential areas that are near transportation and other infrastructure.

Despite the negative trends noted in the report, Foster said there are reasons for optimism. The region has a long history of support for land conservation, and in recent years regional conservation partnerships have multiplied. State and municipal efforts have also been expanding. For example, the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act allows towns to add a surcharge of up to 3 percent to property taxes and direct the revenue to preservation. The program is voluntary, but 11 towns signed on last year, bringing the total to 173, nearly half the state’s 351 communities.

Another positive factor, Foster said, is that conservation opportunities abound. Conservation organizations are regularly contacted by landowners interested in setting aside land or protecting it from development. The problem, Foster said, is that for many of these individuals, much of the wealth is tied up in the land, which makes the development of innovative programs and identifying new funds important.

“There are more opportunities than we can handle,” Foster said.

Foster noted growing recognition of the benefits of conserving forests, creating opportunities for an array of partnerships — such as with health care organizations that recognize the benefits of natural areas — that may not have been possible in the past.

“The capacity for conservation in New England is unrivaled in the world,” he said. “We know that there are huge emerging opportunities for land protection and we know that when similar opportunities occurred in the past, the states, local municipalities, and conservation organizations collaborated to seize on these.”                                                                                                                                                                                                 0279736-f708d78ac26633642b1b110a064ae0fc.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002640 00000000000 015023  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Doctor and River Song are the ultimate on-again-off-again couple.

We already know that River will appear in this year’s Christmas special, and that she doesn’t recognise the Doctor, but we didn’t know when exactly the story will take place.

Until Steven Moffat told us in this week’s edition of the Radio Times.

“It doesn’t really matter, but for those who care,” (it does matter, and we do, Steven) “it’s immediately after The Angels Take Manhattan [2012].”

For those without instant recall of our story guide (shame on you) the Moff clarifies the timeline: “River’s just seen Matt Smith’s Doctor lose Amy and Rory, and obviously before The Name of the Doctor [2013] because she’s dead in that.”

Speaking of ending things, Moffat also revealed that this might have been his last ever Doctor Who episode.

“We’ve just lost Clara, so I didn’t want to go straight into a new companion,” he went on. “I’ll be honest, I brought River Song back in because I thought there was a possibility I’d never write it [Doctor Who] again so that’d be my goodbye.”

Please, we’ve had all the goodbyes we can take recently.

UWTI, which will still trade over-the-counter after its delisting, exploded in popularity last year as a means to get leveraged exposure to fluctuations in the oil market. Just last month, it surged about 25% after word of the OPEC deal to cut production sent oil prices flying CLF7, +0.00% .

Because of moves like that, UWTI quickly became a favorite of Reddit’s Wall Street Bets, a particularly brash corner of the internet where young traders would compare notes and talk trash about their daily profits and losses. In fact, UWTI ranked fifth in TD Ameritrade’s top 10 list of shares most traded by millennials in 2015; it wasn’t among the top 10 most traded by older investors.

UWTI is not something to be tucked away for the long term, and investors realize that, with the average holding period less than six days, according at Deutsche Bank.

Nowadays, even though the volume remains strong during the countdown to delisting, UWTI is no longer the buzzy play it once was, according to Wall Street Bets creator Jaime Rogozinski.

“It was simply the leveraged synthetic derivative of the month,” he said, adding that members are more focused on Donald Trump and marijuana stocks at the moment. “I’m sure the day that 5x leveraged ETFs come out they’ll be the hot topic as well.”

Perhaps another oil play will emerge to fill the void. Just two weeks after Credit Suisse announced the UWTI delisting, U.S. Commodity Funds filed a preliminary prospectus for a triple-leveraged exchange-traded fund linked to light, sweet crude futures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       0279722-cfd4d052e7ee3120dbea56369a68208c.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000006671 00000000000 015206  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Op-ed: One Little Word Means the World

For the first time in the history of the United States a president mentioned bisexual, lesbian, and transgender people in their State of the Union speech. This is an amazing highlight for the bisexual community.

During the Obama administration, bisexual Americans have enjoyed attention unprecedented in history. I had the honor of attending the 2013 White House LGBT Pride Month reception with my partner and other bisexual community leaders. That September, on International Celebrate Bisexuality Day, the White House hosted the first ever bisexual delegation to the administration to talk about policy concerns for the community and how to best meet the unique needs of bisexual people in the United States.

In a culture where even saying the word "bisexual" is a huge taboo, both in media and in personal lives, having one of the most powerful people in the world use it is incredible. Now that President Obama has said the elusive and oft-scorned b word, there is no reason for others to skirt the issue.

The State of the Union address is considered to an all-ages, all-citizens affair. The president used the word. It was not censored or bleeped. The president's utterance was more than a mere throwaway mention or nod. It was a decree. Bisexuals, bisexuality, is is a cause of equality worth fighting for, it is acceptable, and above all it is real.

Over the last several years the attempts to diminish and invalidate bisexual history, culture and community have helped to establish a legacy of disparity instead of hope, with bisexual erasure whittling away bi contributions to LGBT history and biphobia actively preventing bi people — especially bi youth, bi people of color, and bi trans people — from accessing lifesaving resources.

As prominent bisexual scholar Dr. Herukhuti tweeted shortly after Obama's address, "Now that #POTUS is including #bisexuals in #SOTU it is time 2 include bisexuals in federal policy & mainstream LGBTQ advocacy. #teambisexual"

Looking at services provided by LGBT centers in the U.S., only a couple identify bisexual community populations as worthy of service. Why is there so much fear when a single word could save someone's life? The very word "bisexual" has been rife with controversy. From simple erasure in favor of terms like "gay marriage" and "gay and lesbian" to wanting to do away with the word on false grounds of transgender inclusivity, as happened at the National Gay and Lesbian (now LGBT)Task Force in 2014 during the first-ever Bisexual Awareness Week. As I wrote then, this idea isn’t rooted in the idea of complex language but biphobia. When people talk about how words reinforce the binary, it is only ever in regard to bisexuality.

In the coming year ahead I hope that more people, in politics, media, and in personal lives, can embrace using the word bisexual. Bisexual has too long been a word relegated to the shadows because of the incorrect assumption that it is a dirty, vulgar, transphobic, and tainted word. Not any more. Thanks to the tireless work of activists, educators, and now President Obama, there is no need to hide or skirt around it. The word is "bisexual." The president of the United States of America can say it. Can you?

AUD TRAHER is a bisexual transgender activist and writer living in rural Pennsylvania. They have written for publications such as Bi Magazine, BiNet and the Task Force. They are currently writing a coming out book for bisexual teens and young adults.                                                                       0279715-5ddd52329b021fda6769c35c9b15470d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002217 00000000000 015043  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The Tavern, a fixture on Austin’s bar scene since 1933, will soon have a new owner. Ellis and Austin Winstanley — the brothers behind Austin mainstays El Arroyo, Cain and Abel’s, Abel’s on the Lake, Abel’s North, Star Seeds Cafe, and Hill’s Cafe — have put the downtown party spot up for sale.

They’re selling the business, including the equipment, but not the 101-year-old building; the brothers don’t own the structure.

“My brother and I are known for rescuing local and historical small restaurant brands, and turning them around to maintain their place in the community as job creators,” Ellis Winstanley said in testimony before a congressional committee in 2013.

No word on the price tag that the Winstanleys have put on the West 12th Street and North Lamar Boulevard bar. The brothers took over The Tavern in 2012.

According to the Austin Business Journal, the Winstanleys are also shutting down Abel’s North on West Parmer Lane to convert the space into “creative” offices. The Winstanleys say they are reducing their food and beverage holdings so they can focus more on their other business ventures as well as their families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0279589-f13835972c5ce0290de58667b2dd2135.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000003132 00000000000 014720  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        It’s 8 AM, my coffee drips through the filter and I’m preparing my lunch for the afternoon. I’m feeling a bit stressed and excited. The feeling most of us experience before an important event. Today my final aviation exam, from 14 written ones, is about to start. Because it is my second to last chance I’m slightly more nervous than usual. Luckily I have 10 minutes left to meditate, I make myself comfortable and close my eyes…

Meditation, the old tradition of Buddhism has become more popular in the West in recent years. Research even shows that 1 in 10 people in the US practice some kind of meditation. An unfortunate effect is that some see meditation as another hype. Others will prejudge it as nonsense, something only for the spiritual.

Nothing could be further from the truth. It is scientifically proven by dozens of studies that meditation provides cognitive as well as psychological benefits. A recent study on a mindfulness meditation found increased gray-matter density in the hippocampus, known to be important for learning and memory, and in structures associated with self-awareness. Participants even reported reductions in stress and anxiety.

Backing this up with my own experiences I want to share some of my insights about the practice of meditation. My exam that day went better than expected and that wasn’t the only time it helped me through important events.

In this article I will describe a meditation technique that gets you started as well as other advanced techniques. I will also give background information so you can gain a better understanding about what meditation conveys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      0279756-47d96f093a5b33e8bb1be2b637f4e5f5.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000010317 00000000000 015222  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        Bernadett Szabo / Reuters Elod Novak, deputy chairman of Hungary's far-right Jobbik Party, burns an EU flag during an anti-EU demonstration in January.

Many of the right-wing parties that won big in the European Union elections that concluded on Sunday ran heavily against immigrants and, in many places, LGBT rights. Some of these parties still hold only a small share of their countries' seats, but their numbers could be crucial if the right wants to form an official bloc within the European Parliament. A joint report by the European branch of the International Gay and Lesbian Association and the European Network Against Racism catalogues 30 incidents of what the groups call "hate speech" from candidates during the election. Here are some highlights:

Hungary's Jobbik Party campaigns against Conchita Wurst. cink.hu / Via cink.hu

Hungary's Jobbik party released posters earlier this month in which Eurovision winner, Conchita Wurst, a character of drag performer Tom Neuwirth, is superimposed on an EU flag, facing off against a blond woman before a Hungarian flag. Emblazoned across both images were the words, "You choose!" Following a debate earlier this month, party spokesperson Dóra Dúró said that opposing "bearded women" was a way Jobbik supports a "family-based social construction and national traditional values." Jobbik won 14.68 percent of the Hungarian vote.

An Austrian MEP said Europe is becoming a "Negro conglomerate." facebook.com / Via facebook.com

Andras Mölzer, a sitting Member of the European Parliament (MEP) with the Austrian Freedom Party, said that Europe's sliding work ethic was leading it to become a "Negro conglomerate" in "total chaos." At an event in February, Mölzer said: Everyone is laughing at us Germans and Austrians. We are the only ones that are on time for an appointment. We are the only ones who are work at 9am and not 11am. And it's really true. It is a question of the workplace, the work ethic, that Europe is built from. Either we are a Negro conglomerate, [in] total chaos. I say this now even though it's brutally politically incorrect. That is where the chaos multiplies, where mass immigration, where institutional chaos, where tangled corporate interests [are]. Möler also compared the European Union to the Third Reich. His party won 19.7 percent of the vote in Austria.

During an election night rally in The Hague, Geert Wilders, leader of the Party For Freedom, asked supporters, "What do you want in this city? More Moroccans, or less?" The crowd responded by chanting, "Less!" "We'll fix it," Wilders replied. The Party For Freedom won 13.2 percent of the vote.

A Latvian MEP suggested pride parades should be banned to prevent opening the door to "pedophile marches." Alexander Mirsky of the Alternative Party endorsed a Russian-style ban on "homosexual propaganda" and suggested a gay pride march could be followed by a march of pedophiles. "It is necessary to prohibit children under 14 from participating in sexual discussions, and also to prohibit the conduct of public demonstrations that propagandize unhealthy sexuality," Mirsky said in remarks reported in April. "Now homosexuals will hold gay parades, and then what — pedophiles will have their own marches?" The Alternative Party won 4.5 percent of the vote.

The Fratelli d'Italia's Magdi Cristiano Allam, who was born in Egypt and converted to Catholicism at the age of 55, pledge to "stop Mosques" in this campaign leaflet, decrying the "Islamic invasion." The leaflet also says, "Islam preaches hatred, violence, and death." His party won 3.66 percent of the vote.

Danish People's Party MEP Morten Messerschmidt blasted EU funding for the European branch of the International Gay and Lesbian Association (ILGA-Europe) in an April Facebook post. Though he doesn't attack LGBT rights, he accuses activists of "using force" in newer EU member states to promote their cause. The Danish People's Party won the largest share of the vote in Denmark, 26.6 percent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 0279716-93db4b1464b30a549b12126c6c97b2bd.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000002714 00000000000 015031  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled Saturday to have their first phone call since Trump became president, White House sources told Fox News.

Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday that Putin intends to congratulate Trump on taking office, adding that the two leaders are also “exchange views about main parameters of current bilateral relations."

The two last spoke when Putin congratulated Trump on his presidential election victory.

The Kremlin has applauded Trump's promises to mend ties with Moscow, which have plunged to post-Cold War lows over the Ukrainian crisis, the war in Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. elections. Russian officials and lawmakers have warned, however, that rebuilding ravaged ties will take time.

Barack Obama's administration and the European Union slapped Moscow with sanctions for its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and support for a pro-Russia insurgency in eastern Ukraine.

The restrictions have limited Russian companies' access to international financial markets and barred key technology transfers, helping drive the Russian economy into recession. Russia has responded by banning imports of most Western agricultural products.

Asked about the claims that Trump was considering an order to lift the U.S. sanctions against Russia, Peskov said he has no information about it.

Proving the need for quantum computers

Quantum proof Scientists have reached a milestone in the search for proof that quantum computers are really necessary.

Dr Matthew Broome, of the University of Queensland, and colleagues, report their findings today in the journal Science.

"Quantum computers generate so much excitement because they allow one to solve problems that you couldn't do efficiently using a conventional computer," says Broome.

Quantum computers rely on the laws of quantum mechanics such as "superposition" and "entanglement".

"We've built small scale quantum computers but none of them to date have been able to outperform the standard classical computer," says Broome.

Since quantum computers are difficult to build, scientists want to be sure they are worth the effort by finding a problem that can be "mathematically proven" to be unsolvable by classical computers.

One candidate for this is the "boson sampling problem" which involves sending a number of single photons through a complex photonic network, and working out which outputs the photons exit.

Scientists calculate that if 20 to 30 photons were put into the system, a classical supercomputer would have difficulty solving the problem.

"It would be able to solve it but it would take a very long time and meantime a quantum computer would have done it," says Broome.

If experimental proof verified this then the boson sampling problem could indeed be used to prove the need for a quantum computer.

But since producing multiple photons at the same time is not as easy as it sounds, Broome and colleagues wanted to test the boson sampling problem at a small scale.

"You're not going to go ahead and do the full-scale 20-photon experiment first up," says Broome. "The first thing you're going to do is to make sure this thing works which is what we did in our experiment."

Broome and colleagues built a simple quantum computer, called a boson sampling computer, especially designed to solve the boson sampling problem.

He and colleagues sent three photons through six fibre-optic inputs in the computer - a system which was simple enough to be modelled and solved on a classical computer.

Both classical computer and boson sampling computer came up with the same results, which means the stage is now set to try and solve the problem at a larger scale, says Broome.

But he says right now, scientist are being held back by the number of single photons they can produce at the same time. Broome and colleagues hope to be able to simultaneously produce eight photons soon.

The boson sampling computer built by Broome was among the first in the world - another one has been built by other researchers who published in the same issue of Science.

While boson sampling computers are only simple quantum computers, scientists like Broome hope they will also be capable of solving other problems that are beyond the realm of even the best world's supercomputer.                                                                                                           0279611-8850d339eedc3db1439839226589b98d.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000016517 00000000000 014744  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        The man charged with driving a Texas tractor-trailer packed with immigrants in the U.S. illegally will remain in detention after an initial court appearance.

James Matthew Bradley Jr. was handcuffed and wearing blue jail scrubs as U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Chestney explained he could face the death penalty if convicted. Bradley is charged with transporting immigrants here illegally, resulting in the deaths of 10 people.

Bradley, 60, of Clearwater, Florida didn't speak about what happened Sunday.

Chestney scheduled another hearing Thursday.

A federal complaint says Bradley told authorities he was driving the trailer to Brownsville, Texas, and was unaware that it was packed with people until he stopped at a Wal-Mart in San Antonio.

James Mathew Bradley Jr., 60, of Clearwater, Florida, arrived in San Antonio, Texas court on Monday in handcuffs

During his court appearance, he didn't speak as he was charged with transporting immigrants to the U.S. illegally, resulting in the deaths of 10

Bradley told authorities he was driving the trailer to Brownsville and was unaware that it was packed with people until he stopped at a Wal-Mart

Authorities fear the death toll could rise because many of those rescued from the sweltering truck in San Antonio have been hospitalized with extreme dehydration and heatstroke. Eight were dead at the scene, while two later died at the hospital.

The federal complaint says the immigrants packed into the tractor-trailer discovered outside a Texas Wal-Mart were taking turns breathing through a hole in the trailer and pounding on the walls to get the driver's attention.

A passenger in the trailer told investigators that he and others who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally were guided into the trailer to be taken north to San Antonio.

The complaint says passengers appeared fine during the first hour of their journey, but people later began to struggle to breathe. They were trying to get the driver's attention, but to no avail.

Bradley, however, told cops that he was taking the tractor-trailer to its new owner in Brownsville, and had no idea what was in the cargo hold. He said that it wasn't until he made a stop at the Wal-Mart to urinate, that he heard the people pounding on the inside to get out.

'Bradley said he went to open the doors and was surprised when he was run over by "Spanish" people and knocked to the ground,' the affidavit says.

Bradley told police that he noticed 'bodies just lying on the floor like meat' and that he knew at least one of them was dead. He also said that he knew the trailer's refrigeration system didn't work and that the four vent holes were likely clogged.

'Bradley stated he went back to the tractor and called his wife but she didn't answer. Bradley said he did not call 911,' the affidavit says.

It was a Wal-Mart employee who called to alert 911 about the suspicious vehicle, around 12:30am on Sunday.

When officers arrived on the scene, they found Bradley in the camper, between the cab and the trailer.

It was not immediately known whether Bradley had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

Meanwhile, the lieutenant governor of Texas has blamed the deaths of ten illegal immigrants on sanctuary cities.

In a Facebook post on Sunday, Dan Patrick said if it wasn't for sanctuary cities, which refuse to work with the federal government in deporting illegal immigrants, the tragedy in San Antonio would never have happened.

'Sanctuary cities entice people to believe they can come to America and Texas and live outside the law. Sanctuary cities also enable human smugglers and cartels.

'Today, these people paid a terrible price and demonstrate why we need a secure border and legal immigration reform so we can control who enters our country. We continue to pray for the families and friends of the victims,' Patrick, a Republican, wrote.

On Sunday morning, emergency crews pulled dozens of people from a sweltering tractor-trailer parked outside a Walmart in the midsummer heat.

Ten people are dead and the death toll could rise, as 30 others were taken fro the rig and hospitalized in dire condition, with extreme dehydration and heatstroke.

Ten people died after being crammed in the back of an 18-wheeler in San Antonio, Texas this weekend. Above, investigators taking evidence from the scene on Sunday

The ten people were all illegal immigrants. The air conditioning was not working in the back of the truck on a day when the temperatures remained in the 90s

The group were found in the back of the truck, which was parked at a San Antonio Walmart

The victims 'were very hot to the touch. So these people were in this trailer without any signs of any type of water,' San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said.

Authorities would not say whether the trailer was locked when they arrived, but they said it had no working air conditioning.

It was just the latest smuggling-by-truck operation to end in tragedy. In one of the worst cases on record in the U.S., 19 immigrants locked inside a stifling rig died in Victoria, Texas, in 2003.

Based on initial interviews with survivors of the San Antonio tragedy, more than 100 people may have been packed into the back of the 18-wheeler at one point in its journey, ICE acting Director Thomas Homan said. Officials said 39 people were inside when rescuers arrived, and the rest were believed to have escaped or hitched rides to their next destination.

Four of the survivors appeared to be between 10 and 17 years old, Homan said. Investigators gave no details on where the rig began its journey or where it was headed.

But Homan said it was unlikely the truck was used to carry the immigrants across the border into the United States. He said people from Latin America who rely on smuggling networks typically cross the border on foot and are then picked up by a driver.

'Even though they have the driver in custody, I can guarantee you there's going to be many more people we're looking for to prosecute,' Homan said.

San Antonio is about a 150-mile drive from the Mexican border. The temperature in San Antonio reached 101 degrees on Saturday and didn't dip below 90 degrees until after 10pm.

The tragedy came to light after a person from the truck approached a Walmart employee and asked for water late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, said McManus, the local police chief.

The employee gave the person water and then called police, who found the dead and the desperate inside the rig. Some of those in the truck ran into the woods, McManus said.

On Sunday evening, about 100 people gathered at a San Antonio church for a vigil to mourn those killed.

Immigrants' rights activists and church officials held up handmade signs reading 'Who here is not an immigrant' and 'No human is legal.'

The Border Patrol has reported at least four truck seizures this month in and around Laredo, Texas. On July 7, agents found 72 people crammed into a truck with no means of escape, the agency said.

The Obama administration arrested him in February, 2016, and held him without bail on charges he knocked the hospital off the internet during an online fund-raiser, hurting no one.

Republicans shouldn’t celebrate the end of the Obama presidency just yet. Not only has Obamacare survived Trump’s first attempt to repeal and replace it, but many leaders of the former administration still remain and are firmly in control of their offices.

Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in the Justice Department, where Attorney General Sessions is working to solidify his hold amid leaks, partisan attacks, and the at best half-hearted attempts undertaken by former Obama staffers to supposedly achieve the goals of the new administration. Seriously, do either Republicans or Democrats expect the acting US attorneys and their assistants who were hired during the Obama years from places like his home state of Hawaii, or other Democratic strongholds like Massachusetts, to actually fight for traditional conservative values and Trump’s executive orders? Is it any surprise the ACLU used federal courts and attorneys in Boston to successfully challenge the new administration or that Hawaii’s state attorney general Doug Chin, a Democrat, recently triumphed over his federal counterparts there?

As a winner of two presidential elections, and a Harvard law grad, no other president in living memory better understood the political uses of the Justice Department nor entrenched themselves there more deeply than the former president of the Harvard Law Review. Remember, days into the brand new Trump administration, when acting Attorney General Sally Yates ordered the Justice Department not to defend the President’s executive order, forcing him to fire her? Even with her gone, how many of her former supporters are still loyal to their previous bosses, who hired/promoted them, and are still following their orders? That’s the type of fanatical opposition and sabotage Attorney General Sessions has to contend with in the virtual game of whack-a-mole he’s playing with the remnants of Obama’s Department of Justice (DOJ.)

Except these moles whack back. To be sure though, the Obama administration didn’t pioneer the weaponization of the DOJ for political purposes, but they did innovate the practice to new heights that are still paying dividends to Democrats.

For a recent example, despite potential violations of attorney-client privilege and presidential communication privilege, Yates now wants to testify before the House Committee investigating alleged ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Her desire to do so made partisan headlines when letters sent to her by the DOJ asserting the impropriety of such testimony were provided to the Washington Post. Given who they were mailed from and to, it’s all but certain they were sent to the Post by Yates or those acting on her behalf. So, knowing the lengths Yates was willing to go to as acting Attorney General in order to damage Trump as well as the circumstances under which those letters surfaced, could anyone really trust a single word she’d utter to the House?

I have some questions I’d like to ask Yates under penalty of perjury regarding her actions and inactions at the Obama DOJ. I hope if she does testify, members of the committee will take the opportunity to ask questions that may illuminate her motives and reflect on her credibility. Questions such as: How did the Washington Post get the letters the DOJ sent Yates? How did her political ideology affect her decision not to defend Trump’s executive order despite her constitutional obligations to do so? Did she or anyone she knew at the Obama DOJ ever (mis)use their roles to damage political opponents?

Perhaps opponents like Republican Representative Aaron Schock of Illinois, who was federally indicted just following the November elections? Apparently, Obama prosecutors wanted to very selectively make federal felonies out of a Congressman having a lavish office and a large dinner tab, but they seem to have forgotten a certain family on which the Simpson’s character Mayor “Diamond” Joe Quimby is based, not to mention numerous other Democrats who basically do the same things. Now, it’s likely the prosecutors in this case knew the indictment wouldn’t stand scrutiny under the new administration, but it’s doubtful that obtaining a conviction was really their goal. Given the timing, it’s far more likely the intent was to damage his reputation and help flip his coveted seat in the House in the upcoming midterm elections.

In another case, the New York Times reported on the sentencing of Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, two members of Chris Christie’s administration, for supposed roles in “Bridgegate.” Federal judge Susan Wigenton was right to call it a “sad day” for New Jersey, and perhaps “What occurred in September of 2013 was an outrageous display of abuse of power,” as she said, but it might not have been the only one relevant to the case. I only wish that the type of egregious government abuse that held Justina Pelletier captive for 16 months, paralyzed, and nearly killed her, got the kind of instant national headlines and federal investigation that a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge received. Why did the torture of a child in Massachusetts receive so little attention in the traditional media, and no federal investigation by the Obama administration, while “Bridgegate” received so much of both? Perhaps the New York Times buried the lead when it waited until halfway through its article to say “the political damage to Christie, who saw his presidential ambitions dashed and national reputation tarnished, was both immediate and lasting.”

Ironically, at the “Bridgegate” sentencing Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes actually said “those are the actions out of the playbook of some dictator of a banana republic” and “it’s incomprehensible such action could take place here in the United States.” I wonder how Cortes would label what happened to the Pelletiers in Boston?

Janell Fluckiger, executive director of the nonprofit Shelter the Homeless, which will own the two sites in Salt Lake City and one in South Salt Lake, told members of a state homeless committee the church would operate the thrift store through Nov. 30 before selling it to the nonprofit.

Construction would then begin almost immediately under the framework approved by the State Homeless Coordinating Committee on Tuesday, which continued moving ahead with plans to close the large homeless shelter in the Rio Grande neighborhood and reopen three scattered and smaller sites within two years.

“They’re going to keep that property and continue to lease it as long as they can,” Fluckiger said of the church‘s nonprofit business at 131 E. 700 S.

The Salt Lake County Assessor’s Office values the property at $2.7 million – $1.4 million for the land and $1.3 million for the building. Fluckiger said the property was appraised at $4.7 million, but noted Salt Lake City led negotiations into the purchase. The city originally sought to purchase a site for a women’s shelter near the Sugar House neighborhood for $7 million before backing away.

Once the business is closed, construction will begin quickly and ”all interests in the property will revert to the state” if ”substantial construction” isn’t completed by June 30, 2018.

The existing building – along with the building at 275 W. High Ave – will be demolished and replaced with the new shelters by May 2019, according to a timeline Fluckiger provided at Tuesday’s meeting.

PROPERTY PRICES



131 E. 700 So. • $4.6 million



275 W. High Ave. • $3.2 million



3380 So. 1000 W. • $570,275







The site in South Salt Lake at 3380 S. 1000 W. is vacant. Shelter the Homeless paid $3.2 million for the High Avenue site and $570,275 for the South Salt Lake land. The High Avenue site is valued at $1 million, and the vacant land near the Salt Lake County jail is valued at $250,000, assessor’s records show.

The two shelters in Salt Lake City will be 60,000 square feet each. The Deseret Industries site will host 200 women and the High Avenue site will host a mix of 200 men and women. The 90,000-square-foot shelter in South Salt Lake will host 300 homeless men.

There wasn’t much discussion before the committee unanimously approved the purchase prices.

During a recent meeting of the Shelter the Homeless board, developer Kem Gardner let loose information that the Mormon church planned to make a donation after the sale of the property.

Recounting his conversation with Bishop Dean Davies, the first counselor in the LDSChurch’s Presiding Bishopric, Gardner said: “He said, ‘Kem, let’s do it this way: you buy the ground, let me see what I need to do in the whole scope of what you have to do, and we’ll make a very generous donation.” Gardner said of his conversation with Bishop Dean Davies, the first counselor in the LDS Church’s Presiding Bishopric.

A spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday on the sale.

The inclusion of the construction deadlines indicates state, city, county and other officials working on improving homelessness services are hoping to quickly make inroads on helping a population visibly struggling with addiction, among other issues.

Detox center in Murray



Kathy Bray, president and CEO of the Volunteers of America, Utah, said the group is hoping to reopen a facility in Murray for single women and women with children who are suffering from addiction. An existing facility was staffed around the clock until it closed for lack of funding in May 2014.

Bray estimated it would cost $1.2 million annually to operate the center, which has 28 beds. The committee has already approved providing $1 million for renovating the facility in preparation for its reopening.

“It would essentially be a second detox center in Salt Lake County,” Bray said. ”The need is so great, the demand is so high right now to help people to come off alcohol, heroin, methamphetamine, and we have a lot of momentum around reducing homelessness numbers.”

For the last couple weeks, Andrew Kurcan (a Denverite) has been hanging photography all over Boulder with signs that read "Please steal". A $1,000 grant from the Boulder Awesome Foundation ensures every piece (there are 40 pieces) is enclosed and matted in a frame, then mounted on buildings, fences, etc. in a 'non-damaging' fashion.

Kurcan took a minute out of his day to tell us about the project.



How did you come up with the idea?

I came up with the idea from years of living in different cities across the states, and being exposed to many different types of street art and graffiti. I often wondered what would happen if I tried to take the same approach with traditionally presented fine art photography. The idea of a non-restrictive exhibition was quite alluring. Really it was one of those "why not?" moments.

In what other cities would you consider putting up photo graffiti?

I wish I would have been able to do this in every city I've lived in or spent any measurable amount of time in. I gain so much inspiration from the places I go, it feels wonderful to not only give back, but (hopefully) add to the sources of inspiration.

What makes boulder "awesome"? (Other than the Awesome Foundation..)

Boulder is an amazing city full of amazing creative people (who are awesome). It's a funky mix of personalities, stories, and experiences. I've never really found another place like it throughout my travels. When the Boulder chapter of the Awesome Foundation approached me wanting to fund my project bid, I couldn't even think of saying no!



Have any property owners, public officials, rival street gangs, etc. contacted you expressing anger/encouragement?

I've gotten a lot of feedback already, and getting more each day. Most of it is very encouraging... one person actually asked for me to hang another in place of one that they liked, but was taken. Of course there has been a little negative feedback, stating that they view it as littering, etc... but any art polarizes - you have to expect that going into any public project. I was caught in the act hanging quite a few pieces, and those interactions were wonderful... full of genuinely interested questions.

As for rival gangs... I'm not aware of many clandestine art hanging street gangs floating around these parts... in retrospect I would have enjoyed a West Side Story-esque encounter. In all seriousness though, all of my past interactions as a photographer with real taggers and street artists (of the gang and non gang variety), have been great.

Anything else?

The only other thing I can add, is that Boulder was wonderfully accepting to my crazy idea, and I thank the people and city of Boulder for that. And, of course, The Awesome Foundation, to help make it all possible!

You'll notice the date on the tags are off by a year... a misprint on my part. I was going to reprint them, but decided that it was actually more in the spirit of the project to allow the populous to completely control how long the pieces stay up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          0279788-e586e01bf8b8accc1120534c31c01d53.txt                                                        0000644 0000000 0000000 00000012162 00000000000 015106  0                                                                                                    ustar                                                                   0000000 0000000                                                                                                                                                                        This is the sound of settling.

I'm not going to try and argue that the Ottawa Senators are getting good value for their money when it comes to Alex Kovalev. Although his 50P (18G, 32A) in 83GP seems half-decent at first, it's skewed upwards by some huge games that conceal the many games where Kovalev has been all but invisible. And it doesn't note that in the last 23 games Kovalev has played, he has a grand total of three points.

But we get to a point where continually ragging on the guy gets old. Fast. I've never been a huge critic of the signing; I thought it was to much money for a player who would have limited effectiveness, yes, but I thought Kovalev would bring a much-needed scorers touch to round out the Senators offence. That hasn't happened, at least not consistently. But Kovalev hasn't been terrible in Ottawa, as much as some fans might want to think he has.

When he was brought in, Kovalev was immediately hated by Sens fans. I think some of it had to do with his time on the Montreal Canadiens, and his comments about loving that time even after signing in Ottawa. And Jeremy Milks of Black Aces has long maintained the Sens fans harbour an automatic distrust for skilled players, hearkening back to Alexei Yashin, and thinks that's a big reason why Jason Spezza hasn't been fully embraced by Ottawa--and, one could assume, this would also affect Kovalev's reputation in Ottawa. I think he's on to something. But Kovalev, according to calculations by François Neville of The 6th Sens, was the twenty-ninth most valuable right-winger in the NHL last year--proving what we all thought, that he is overpaid (he was around the top-ten highest-paid right-wingers last season), but not horrifically.

And let's be honest: The Ottawa Senators have much bigger problems than the seemingly disinterested play of one 37-year-old right winger.

Ottawa needs better from Kovalev, to be sure. But they need better from just about every player on the roster. They need players to start playing together, to stop taking stupid penalties (especially too-many-men penalties), to use positional hockey to compensate for an apparently slower-than-average team, to buy into a functional breakout that can work around the soft defence corps to mitigate oppositional forechecking, and they need to get their powerplay going. Until even a couple of those get together, it won't matter whether Kovalev is playing like he did ten years ago, or whether he plays like he might ten years from now: The Senators will still be losing more games than they win.

There have been calls for the Senators to send Kovalev to the Binghamton Senators, either as punishment or to help him 'find his game'. In either case, it would offer no help to the Senators.
